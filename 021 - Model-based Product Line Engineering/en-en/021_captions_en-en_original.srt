00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,319
welcome to our new episode of our mbse

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,438
podcast

10
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,400
today

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
from our series mbse methodologies

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
and we have an exciting topic that moves

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
many many projects variant modeling or

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
more generally model based product line

15
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,159
engineering

16
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
and we have a guest who knows the topic

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,720
very well marco valengiri from airbus so

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,200
marco welcome and great to have you with

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
us please introduce yourself and then we

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
will dive into the topic

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
hello team hi christian so it's a very

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
big pleasure to be part of this podcast

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
and uh yes i'm a marco for lingerie

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720
working currently in airbus and leading

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,040
the model-based product line

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,759
engineering topic so it's quite long

27
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,960
but

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
we had the word on the existing

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
concept and yes i joined airbus

30
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,840
2020 in the middle of the pandemic but

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
i've been working with this topic

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
already since 2012

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
so actually almost 10 years

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,679
and yes working different companies

35
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
before i started at bombardier

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
transportation when was stillborn body

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
transportation

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
now is alstom

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
then moved to ibm and consulting to

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
apply mbsc and product line engineering

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
enterprise architecture especially in

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
different companies

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
and industries then to accenture

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
and finally

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
airbus so and i always worked with the

46
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,280
product line engineering

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,959
model-based system engineering so these

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
are the main two areas of

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
experience

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
no it's a long journey

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
yeah speaking of model based product

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
line engineering or product line

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
engineering and mbse maybe we should

54
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,959
explain to our listeners

55
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
what is product line engineering and how

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,400
is it related to mbse

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
so this is the first the first question

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
everybody asked me

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
at airbus so i have to repeat this

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,000
100 times yeah so it's really simple

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
okay so

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
we have mbsc

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
one of the main scope of mbsc is a

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
model we use okay so we would like to

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
reuse as much as possible models

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
and we would like to reuse the model

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
that we developed for one single project

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
in multiple projects when a manager said

69
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,720
okay let me

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
have a look at mbsc which is the return

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
of investment

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
then most of the managers

73
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
since they invest a lot of money in the

74
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
initial mbs investment then they would

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,360
like

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
to reuse these models in multiple

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
projects for example in multiple

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
programs now

79
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
the reuse part

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
can be improved by product line

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,200
engineering so if we apply product line

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
engineering to mbsc then we can boost

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
the reuse of models but this doesn't

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
apply only to models it applies also

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
other type of artifacts like

86
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
requirements test cases source codes

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
design artifacts like 3d electrical

88
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
design and so on

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
and at the core

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,599
of this methodology

91
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,839
there is the management definition and

92
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
management of variability

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
so we need to be sure that we have a

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
single source

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
of variability

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
and this single source of variability

97
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,120
enable the reuse

98
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
of the different assets overall on top

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,080
of all the assets the mbsc the system

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
so

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,759
but in mbs ple there many different

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,199
terms around and

103
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
they are very often mixed up

104
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
and one of those terms is i think the

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,199
term feature

106
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
well it's a very important term in mba

107
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
ple

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
but it's also an important term in uml

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,199
or system modeling but there's something

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
different and then but of course it's

111
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,280
also a natural english term so what is

112
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
the feature in mbple

113
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
so a feature is like

114
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
the quidd

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
if we use the latin word of

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
for that because it's something that

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
everybody talk about

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
but nobody is able really to define okay

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
right so when i start a project where we

120
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
support the definition of availability

121
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
one of the first questions what is a

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
feature then some people start to say a

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,039
feature is a really abstract

124
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
characteristic of a system say okay good

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
but then okay can be something more

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
physical can be

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
something describing more physical

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
characteristic implementation

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
characteristic yes can be i am quite

130
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
flexible in the use of

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
features for me

132
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
uh it's like whenever you have

133
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,919
availability

134
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,120
uh and you in this variability is not

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
just in one specific aspect but it's

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
let's say it spread also multiple assets

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
and you want to control this variability

138
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
use a feature

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
for that okay

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
and but let's say the official

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
definition of feature if you look at the

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
standard iso two six five and zero and

143
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,479
the first standard

144
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
is there is a characteristic of a system

145
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
of a product that the stakeholders can

146
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
understand

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
that's why

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
it's a

149
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
and there are a lot of more um

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
terms in in this iso standard like asset

151
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,160
and product line of product family

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
we also

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
talked about or you talked about

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
variability

155
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,199
uh then there is a term like variation

156
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
and variant and variation point so can

157
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
you can you give us a rough overview how

158
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
to to bring these terms in order

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
yes okay so i try to refer to the

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,919
standard as much as possible but also to

161
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
deviate a bit because so in airbus we

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
have a different understanding of the

163
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,720
world

164
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,639
so assets after feature you have the

165
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,720
assets let's say that the feature define

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
the variability define the source of

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
variability

168
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
and then you need the why do you define

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,800
this source okay so because you want to

170
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,039
control and reuse the variability that

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
is implemented in several us so the

172
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
asset is actually what you want to reuse

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
and some some standards are so the

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,039
standard

175
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,840
26550 consider feature also on assets

176
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
but for me a feature is uh

177
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
something a bit more than us you know

178
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
because it it it's needed to control the

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
asset and in the reality doesn't exist a

180
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
feature okay

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
uh other types of assets can be as i

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
said system models are assets or source

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,759
code other assets so it's everything

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
that is needed to engineer a product or

185
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
a system

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
that you want to reuse okay

187
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
uh then after this that's we have the

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
concept of product line and product

189
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,599
family so for me the two concepts are

190
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,560
really synonymous okay

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
in airbus i would say

192
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,599
two

193
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,879
but um

194
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
we distinguish more that the product

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
product line can be at any level so it

196
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
can be a system can be a product can be

197
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,160
a component level while the product

198
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
family is really the airbus not the fly

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,360
the airplane products like the a320 a321

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
a330 and so so this is just an internal

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
distribution but for me we can see that

202
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
there are synonyms then we have

203
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
variability and variation what's

204
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,599
variability and variation are somehow

205
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
synonymous but i like to say that i

206
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
define the variability in the future

207
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,519
models and the variation in the assets

208
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,240
why i distinguish like that because i

209
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,479
there is a second term called

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,958
variant and variation points

211
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,000
since

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
there is the word variation that is it

213
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
in both a variant and variation points

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
i prefer to distinguish that the

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
variation in what you implement in the

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
assets what the variability is what you

217
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
define let's say more as a need as a

218
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
source

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
of variability in the future model okay

220
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,560
so um

221
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
the variant is actually the the part in

222
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
your asset that varies okay so that's at

223
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,920
least

224
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
my understanding here how i use the work

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,360
well the variation point is the point in

226
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
the asset where the variability where

227
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,399
the variation starts to propagates okay

228
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,080
so this is basically um

229
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
a bit and

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
of course rough and

231
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
fast definition of these terminologies

232
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
thank you

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
yeah very good so the terms are often

234
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
used very differently and so and i think

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
there's no single source of proof but

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
it's good to

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
that uh you have your own

238
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
uh valid definition of it um and yeah

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,040
you definitely have one and and a

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,320
reference is

241
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,360
iso26550 you already mentioned that

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
standard uh there's another standard the

243
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
new one published last year yeah last

244
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
year uh iso 26580

245
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
uh does that standard replace the other

246
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
one or what what is that

247
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
standard about oh let's say that the new

248
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
standard is an extension or clarify

249
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,079
what come what was before no there uh

250
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
what so the previous standard that's the

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,920
265

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
clarify in brackets

253
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
for me there are some words that in the

254
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
new standard or some terminology a new

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
standard are not so clear okay

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
so i really like the preview standard

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
honestly because

258
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
it was generic it could have been

259
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
applied to different

260
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
if you are using for example ovm

261
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
uh that's uh talking about ability

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
language or if you are using a feature

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
modeling language you had a broader

264
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,680
application

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
now the new one of the biggest

266
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,519
advantages of the new standard that was

267
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
released as we said in june 2021

268
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
is uh probably the console feature based

269
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
because it says that uh if you want to

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,279
develop product

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,519
systems with the product engineering you

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,600
have to do with a feature-based approach

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
and it's something i like a lot

274
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
however i think the standard is still

275
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
too much tool driven the terminology are

276
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
too much uh

277
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,200
put vendor to events and this is

278
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
something that i would like to avoid

279
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
especially for the definition of a

280
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
standard because it should be as much as

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
possible through agnostic also from the

282
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
terminologies and in general the

283
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,519
terminology that are in the 2650

284
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,079
i find that more generic and also clear

285
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
for certain aspects

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,399
that's uh

287
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,120
let's say a bit uh but of course i

288
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
mentioned already

289
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
ovn okay and uh

290
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
i probably i can mention folder that's

291
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
the father or feature modeling language

292
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
and these are different approaches to

293
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
formalize the variability

294
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
so if we can

295
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
the standards don't specify

296
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
any of these approaches and this also i

297
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
find it good

298
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
however

299
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
both approaches are somehow based on

300
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
features

301
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
uh folder that's

302
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,959
the so

303
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
it's basically the the father of uh

304
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
feature modeling

305
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,760
is uh uh

306
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,720
the

307
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
it's explicitly mentioning the features

308
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,399
uh and defining the features while

309
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,480
orthogonal variability model

310
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
is an alternative language where

311
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
feature are not i would say explicitly

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,839
defined

313
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
and

314
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
in the end it depends for me it depends

315
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
on the usage that you want to do i am

316
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,680
not a fan of ovm for example uh for the

317
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,279
following reason

318
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
because their their development is

319
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
defined orthogonally this would be a

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
good thing because you have let's say

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
your mbsc

322
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
models your dc project you have

323
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,360
operational functional logical you may

324
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
have the variability that is impacting

325
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
all the layers okay then you can link

326
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,639
the

327
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,600
the ovm models the variability model

328
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
and with the different assets on the

329
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
different levels photography however

330
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,519
there's no hierarchy

331
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
so there's no hierarchy in the ovm and

332
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
if you build a complex system like we do

333
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
in our bus that we have different levels

334
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
so system of system aircraft a big

335
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,040
system like fuselage cabin smaller

336
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,160
systems and components equipment and so

337
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
on then you get lost okay and it's

338
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
difficult to keep the consistencies of

339
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
the variability that you have defined so

340
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,959
that's why i'm more in favor of a

341
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,920
fodder let's say and of feature modeling

342
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
languages especially cardinality-based

343
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
teacher modeling languages from

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
charnecki that's one of the

345
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
also father of feature modeling and its

346
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,320
application

347
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
but in general both approaches the ovm

348
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
and future modeling that the main one

349
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
can be used for product line engineering

350
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
and product engineering is really the

351
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,639
the

352
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
is at the core of uh variability

353
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
management availability modeling because

354
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
it's really the mechanism that allows

355
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
you to reuse

356
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
assets

357
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
in a systematic way

358
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
for the variability scope that you need

359
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,800
to cover

360
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
so marco

361
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,279
where do you know all the stuff from uh

362
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,360
so when did you start uh experiencing uh

363
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
mple uh even before

364
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
bombardier or

365
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,920
yes so actually i started by by accident

366
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
because

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,199
i was doing my master thesis at

368
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,480
bombardier

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,240
and bombardier transportation was at

370
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
that time it was 2012

371
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
moving from a project oriented

372
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
organization to product line oriented

373
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,160
organization i was ended up

374
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
in the city of chief technology office

375
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,399
of the company

376
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
and we were defined the strategy the

377
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
approaches the methodology that could be

378
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,880
put in place

379
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
and at that time

380
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
when i was so my manager asked me to

381
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,560
do research about that and

382
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
i i found basically these two main

383
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
methodology mbsc

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
and product line engineering

385
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
and then uh

386
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,279
so fortunately another mark will join

387
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
the company so that's that i was marco

388
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
ferogalini that has a similar surname

389
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,800
and

390
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,920
a similar name and we are both italian

391
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,519
and at that time he joined one by the

392
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,079
transportation as a manager trying was

393
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
driving mbsc topic

394
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,279
and uh

395
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,600
and then we we got in touch and then he

396
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,639
we had

397
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
a lot of uh common grounds especially

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
because you work at aston and he already

399
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,160
applied

400
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,959
uh

401
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,680
product engineering with mbsc and he

402
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,839
showed me an article and this article

403
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
was how to boost uh

404
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
mbsc with product engineering an article

405
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
from 2014-2015

406
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,240
one of the first publication and then

407
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
since that time i started to investigate

408
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,279
research more and proposing the company

409
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
the approach and i from the beginning i

410
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,880
saw this strong link with mbsc so that's

411
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
why i i continue then in the other

412
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
companies to promote it within

413
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
bombardier or even with the company i

414
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
work with as a consultant

415
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
in different industry automotive defense

416
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,279
chemical industry railway so

417
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
and it became let's say my baby i would

418
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,399
say i see it really like

419
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,600
a small uh a small baby to

420
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
uh to grow you know and to

421
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,560
those i wanted other people

422
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,759
use it and contribute to that

423
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,079
that's basically the short story of it

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
so well you're definitely an expert of

425
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
mbl pe so one of the

426
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
best choices for airbus

427
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
to manage the the adaption of

428
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,800
mbpe can you give us some some insights

429
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
um how it is standard at airbus

430
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
yes so at airbus we take the topic

431
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
really serious okay so i i quote update

432
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
your

433
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,000
your motto no but um let's say

434
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,959
um

435
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,679
when i joined airbus 2020

436
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,400
there were uh some small proof of

437
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,119
concept about how to use a pure variance

438
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
that's one of the tools okay

439
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
how to use pure variants and doors how

440
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
to use

441
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
other tools uh

442
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
ptc

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,320
token availability modeling ptc how to

444
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,559
use the gears you know was really tool

445
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
oriented

446
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
and uh and actually there were some

447
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
colleagues really really smart and

448
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,559
really

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,720
advanced i would say they try to

450
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
experiment the topic mainly on

451
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
requirements okay so when i arrived what

452
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
i saw it was mainly the application of

453
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,799
product engineering requirements and

454
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
there was at the time a big debate

455
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,799
because uh my manager told marco we have

456
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
to give a name to this

457
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,880
group so i want that you are focused on

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
developing methodology for product

459
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
engineering but we need to give a name

460
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,480
to the

461
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
to the subject okay and then immediately

462
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,679
say model based product and engineering

463
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,360
and then the the the question well yeah

464
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,559
but we also cover also support the

465
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,880
requirement management and because it's

466
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
what we did before no really there were

467
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,640
some projects managing variability

468
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,039
requirements and doors and events but i

469
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
said yes okay it could be that we have

470
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
to cover this aspect and we will cover

471
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
this aspect but the goal the vision is

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
to go to uh mbple approach so to reach

473
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
an mbp so the combination of model basis

474
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
imaging and product engineering so it

475
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
means if we have to reach that of course

476
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
we have to pass through requirement

477
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
engineering viability textual

478
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
requirements but the idea is really to

479
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,360
move

480
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,240
uh

481
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
so the vision really to move to a

482
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
model-based approach and that's

483
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
basically how we started and uh

484
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
what we decided with the team is to

485
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
organize the project give us a framework

486
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
and otherwise the topic was really tool

487
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,799
driven at that time so we start to

488
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,840
define

489
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
uh different framework with different

490
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
categories so we have processes

491
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,280
method and handbooks tools information

492
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,840
models data model

493
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
tools and environments okay so these are

494
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,559
the main categories and we cover we try

495
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
to develop the topic in each category

496
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
for example we have the

497
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,360
system engineering processes

498
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
and airbus business processes so we look

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
at how uh product engineering is

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,799
impacting and mbble is impacting the

501
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,400
system engineering process the system

502
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,799
injury referential mainly based on the

503
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
in cozy handbook

504
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,799
uh the

505
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
airbus business process so it means

506
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
really the company landscape of process

507
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
then at metal

508
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,799
handbook level first we work on method

509
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,559
level so for us method is something that

510
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
is tool independent

511
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
and the handbook is basically the

512
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,240
implementation of the method within a

513
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
specific tool okay so this is the

514
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
difference we have in our bus

515
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
at um the method we start to explore so

516
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
for me one of the key things and team

517
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,080
was involved and helped us also in

518
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
figuring that out

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
because was really a new topic and due

520
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
to his experience with vamos

521
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,200
we

522
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
try to have a look okay how we can model

523
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,280
the variability in xml so it was one of

524
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
the first things that we take of

525
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
doing the mental definition and we have

526
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
several uh discussions several we define

527
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,640
the two main ways of doing it

528
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
and we call clean and direct but

529
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
basically way to model the variability i

530
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
will not enter into the details but

531
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
so really explore methodologically okay

532
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
so what how can we model the variability

533
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
and

534
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
then the next steps was okay now that we

535
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,320
have a

536
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
concept

537
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
how we can implement this concept in the

538
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
existing airbus

539
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
mdsc framework that is called moflt so

540
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
mission uh operational functional

541
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
logical and technique

542
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
and this was a very big challenge and

543
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,520
then comes a new challenge how we can

544
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,679
support now multi-level so it means if

545
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,280
we have variability at multiple level

546
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
multiple system level how we can support

547
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,919
it

548
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
and you know and this was all the

549
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
methodological part that we had to

550
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,440
produce handbooks because we had to

551
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
support user key users in applying this

552
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
and testing is if it was working or not

553
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
and uh we need to be sure that what we

554
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,039
define

555
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,200
can interoperables with other concepts

556
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
for example requirements validation

557
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
verification so we have an

558
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
interoperability model an information

559
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
model data model in airbus where we also

560
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
have to define uh

561
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
variability concept we come back now to

562
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,520
the the concept that we mentioned in the

563
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
beginning what is a variation point and

564
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
how do you link a variation for with an

565
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,559
asset what is a feature what is the

566
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,640
relation between a feature and us and so

567
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
on

568
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
and then the tools so the tools come

569
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
really after all of these so it's not

570
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
the first uh the first

571
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,600
piece of the puzzle

572
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,640
and the

573
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
edit

574
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
also i mean is really important topic

575
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
and we have several solutions we have a

576
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
tactical solution and a strategic

577
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
solution the tactical solution mainly

578
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
based on pure variance and cameo the

579
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
strategic solution will be probably

580
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
based on the 3d experience and the

581
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
sources

582
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,919
and then finally that's for me the most

583
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,320
important part is the environment okay

584
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
the environment is where we really test

585
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
and we collect feedbacks from our users

586
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,799
on the methodology on the tools on

587
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,360
everything we do so we have a page that

588
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
is public to everybody in airbus

589
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,799
everybody can access but we publish all

590
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,960
the information all the content is

591
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
really knowledge based

592
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
and the transparent available to

593
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
everybody and we

594
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
undertaking activities with different

595
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
teams in airbus from space helicopters

596
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,360
doors team wings

597
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
program aircraft

598
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
new flight management system and so on

599
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
zero me show a new program we provide

600
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
them the methodology to the coaches and

601
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
they apply and they provide us feedback

602
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
and we refine the methodology according

603
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
to their feedback sometimes the feedback

604
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
makes sense sometimes

605
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
we we tell them well maybe we you can do

606
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,039
it in a different way we don't have to

607
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,760
change the methodology so this is really

608
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
is really uh how we we work no it's

609
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,120
really a lot a lot to do and it's really

610
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
difficult to explain this in a few words

611
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
but that's really the the big score uh

612
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
at airbus

613
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
so when you talk about airbus you really

614
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
mean

615
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
the whole airbuster you mentioned space

616
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
defense commercial aircraft and so on so

617
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
it's the whole company and not only a

618
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
single project

619
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
no no because maybe i didn't mention

620
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,880
that i should have mentioned otherwise

621
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
my manager

622
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,440
[Music]

623
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
i'm part of a program called ddms for

624
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
digital design manufacturing services

625
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
their program is to transform the way

626
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
airbus engineer

627
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
its products

628
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
and of course in a digital way because

629
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
digital is the first uh word in ddms now

630
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
in the the program

631
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
and in the ideas you want to transform

632
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
the way we engineering the products from

633
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,360
the beginning

634
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
from the

635
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,279
the requirements and the market needs up

636
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,360
to the manufacturing and we want to

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
establish a digital continuity between

638
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
all the data we produced

639
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
of course in a model-based way but one

640
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
of the two main three main pillars of

641
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,120
the ddms in fact uh product line

642
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
modeling and simulation and digital

643
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
continuity so in this three topic match

644
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
really well with mbps

645
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
because you have

646
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
let's say you develop all three within

647
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
ambiguity

648
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
so let's let's spread ple a little bit

649
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
so if i'm a listener and i would like to

650
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
learn about it what are the main sources

651
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
for me

652
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
so first of all the standards so i would

653
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,679
say start with the iso 26550

654
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,039
is the first

655
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
standard

656
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,360
i would say of course you can also have

657
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
a look at the second standard the two

658
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
six five eight zero at the main

659
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
references probably i don't know if you

660
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
will understand a lot if you are a

661
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
beginner the topic because uh sometimes

662
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,919
they are not always clear

663
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,480
i would propose them two main sources

664
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
one form from matthew

665
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,279
uh house those i think uh

666
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,120
that's one of those main systematic

667
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
contributors i think

668
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,159
and uh

669
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,760
he was one of the first to talk about

670
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,919
mbtly especially applying with the ptc

671
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,720
i would say there is a ptc case with

672
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,039
your token availability model uh there

673
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
is a fourth tower availability model we

674
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
have klaus paul

675
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
that's also one of the main

676
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
professor and that developed the oem

677
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,880
topic

678
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
for

679
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
let's say for what concern mbple we have

680
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,440
also uh ferrogallini charlie

681
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,600
the the paper i mentioned before that

682
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,960
from 2015 how to boost mbsc with product

683
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,679
line engineering uh in the rolling stock

684
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
so with the allstone case

685
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,200
and it's really interesting there

686
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,120
because they propose different type of

687
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
reuse strategies

688
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
then of course uh

689
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,000
there is a

690
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
for product line engineering itself

691
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
there are a lot of sources okay i'm just

692
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
referring more on the mvp sources

693
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,279
because then product engineering is like

694
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,039
can be almost like mbsc so you have a

695
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,520
lot of sources and i'm really referring

696
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
and even the standard the standard don't

697
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
talk about mbps so the standard talk

698
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
really about ple so if we want to be

699
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,720
really precise the two standards refer

700
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
just ple

701
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,080
and there's really the two sources that

702
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
talk about mbps are

703
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
matthew hauser

704
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,919
and

705
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,360
ferogalini

706
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,080
from 2014 2016.

707
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
there's not so much actually

708
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,960
i'm actually active and maybe so we'll

709
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,559
come with some publications this year

710
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,000
let's see

711
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
no spoiler but there's not so much

712
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,880
actually

713
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,799
and so there's there's no

714
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,880
official definition of mbpe in a

715
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
standard right so not yet

716
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,120
no that's not and also we have mainly uh

717
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
some two vendors that uh let's say

718
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,039
called their own plugin mbtl

719
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,640
they kind of uh you know use the

720
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,000
the terminology and some people when you

721
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,919
talk about mvp they think immediately

722
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,679
about a specific tool

723
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,840
but in theory it should not be like that

724
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
no because it's more than that and if

725
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,320
you if you today you did it online mbp

726
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,039
you find a lot of demonstrations purely

727
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
based on boots

728
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,640
different tools so rapsody camillo and

729
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
with a big lever variance ptc

730
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
or the main one

731
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,960
but there's not really a theoretical

732
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
foundation or something too agnostic

733
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
yeah speaking of of tool agnostic um

734
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
would it make sense from your point of

735
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,159
view to have some kind of ple modeling

736
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,640
language in addition so to say to system

737
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,960
l or something something standardized

738
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,799
which is uh supported by multiple tools

739
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,080
yes definitely definitely it's not easy

740
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
because as i said

741
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,559
there is not a single understanding

742
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
there are different way of defining it

743
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,159
so one aspect feature model let's start

744
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,760
with teacher model first of all it's not

745
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,120
just feature modeling there's feature

746
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,799
modeling and obian okay the main

747
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,000
languages

748
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
so we which one do we pick okay so we're

749
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,240
already there we'll have a big

750
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
problem to make people agree on that

751
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
some people they know vm is better some

752
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
others the feature modeling no is better

753
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
because of that so we are very therefore

754
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,799
okay

755
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,120
then when we go into the

756
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,200
it's not just about defining features

757
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
it's also about how do we implement

758
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,399
these features how do we implement the

759
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,600
variability

760
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,399
and

761
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
we take now uh

762
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
the two values will will end there also

763
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,799
in the game

764
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,679
also

765
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,399
for example we have some tools that

766
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,480
apply oem some others apply feature

767
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
modeling

768
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,919
some of them would apply a mix of the

769
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,960
two then how do we realize this

770
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
variation point in the different

771
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,279
assets it's not easy to find i think

772
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,320
there were several attempts with the cbl

773
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,799
common variability language there have

774
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,039
been some attempts uh

775
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
with the

776
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
yes but a bd exchange language more on

777
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,480
the exchange

778
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,799
yes exactly but

779
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,320
it's really difficult to find a common

780
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,240
language i would so my dream would be

781
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,120
12. so that's my dream man so don't take

782
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
it as

783
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,360
2m

784
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,480
um

785
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
ple language or feature modeling

786
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,760
language based on csma so this would be

787
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
let's say

788
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
maybe for the omg group

789
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
i'll just leave it like that okay

790
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
yeah maybe as uh

791
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,240
m1 library in sml2 for example

792
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
yeah which is to be interesting system

793
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,320
lb2 will cover uh variability um but not

794
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
feature modeling it's not part of the

795
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,279
language

796
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
but i guess you can use this in lv2 to

797
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,480
do feature modeling but it's not a first

798
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,279
class model element so yeah actually if

799
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,200
i want to really why i said that because

800
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
in airbus we really find useful

801
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,240
uh to have our own feature modelling

802
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,480
it's a way to define feature models

803
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
based on csma

804
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
we have we call it c7 system feature

805
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
modeling

806
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,480
and actually i took it uh from uh

807
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
so the experience and some work that we

808
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
did at bombardier transportation and of

809
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,279
course is the idea at least and then we

810
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,679
refine it and it's really useful because

811
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,399
we

812
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,640
we define the features and directly in a

813
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
model-based way we can already trace

814
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
them to the assets of course the

815
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
transformation is really limited because

816
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,559
we

817
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,480
it's a plug-in that mainly focuses on

818
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
definition of features on the relation

819
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,880
of the constraints it would be good uh

820
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
if this could also

821
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
it could enable the transformation today

822
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,440
for the transformation we need to go to

823
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
those lighter variants we're doing for

824
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,159
then the

825
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,519
the feature model that we define in

826
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,919
coming in pure variance and so on but

827
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,320
the idea there is because the users find

828
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
really user friendly especially if you

829
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
already use a

830
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,039
system system l is really good not to

831
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,519
work with the same similar language and

832
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
with the same model based

833
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,519
functionalities and

834
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
and then be able to link your feature

835
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
directly with your models so there is

836
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,919
definitely an added value for that

837
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,399
yeah yeah and system uh

838
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,799
yeah it has all the the basic concepts

839
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,840
is already there so decomposition and

840
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,159
and all this stuff so it's uh

841
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,840
yeah

842
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
um

843
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,559
yeah so

844
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,200
well if our listeners are now interested

845
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
to learn mbple

846
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,399
uh or to to use in their projects uh

847
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
what's what's your recommendation for

848
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,279
those people um

849
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,120
where should they start and and so

850
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,919
oh first recommendation okay

851
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,720
it's a complex topic but the most

852
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
difficult part is dealing with people

853
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
okay so uh

854
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
because you especially in a big

855
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,679
organization if you're in a big

856
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,440
organization i expect that if you apply

857
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,880
a new daily problem you are in a big

858
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
organization and then you have to

859
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,000
explain what it's and probably these

860
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,480
people already uh

861
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,159
had difficulty to understand what the

862
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,679
mbsc is

863
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,919
and then okay now i got what the nbc now

864
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,120
you go there it's not but there's

865
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,440
something on top it's mbps

866
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
what what is that now

867
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
this is already one of the one

868
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,600
difficulty so really really good i would

869
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
say one recommendation is

870
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,880
clarify exactly what uh if you need mbp

871
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,480
could be that you don't need could be

872
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,840
that first you need to apply good mbsc

873
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,799
and maybe enable the reuse just

874
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,919
on csml with the reusing library or

875
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
modeling in a generic way

876
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,159
or maybe you have a requirement base a

877
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,600
text-based approach and you have to

878
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
reuse the requirements so you just can

879
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,399
apply the

880
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,919
the the feature modeling and the

881
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,320
variability of the variability

882
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,200
definition on the requirements

883
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
but if you really need if you have a

884
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,200
mbac approach and you want to boost

885
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,760
you want to get to the next level then i

886
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
would say you should go with mbps and

887
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,640
the first things clarify basically what

888
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
you cover what what it's covering in

889
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,919
bple and for me it's really the the and

890
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
try to explain it with simple terms to

891
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,159
people so to really show everything vsc

892
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,039
then why we put ple on top what is the

893
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,679
added value i use disney video to show

894
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,360
that you know i because you think in

895
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,840
airbus you deal with people that

896
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
all are analytical engineers no it's not

897
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,880
the case they have to go with sales

898
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
people with marketing so sometimes i use

899
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
a disney video to explain what mbp is we

900
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,440
use coffee machine to explain what uh

901
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,360
how to define the variability it's

902
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
really important to tailor the knowledge

903
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,679
depending which is the stakeholder

904
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,519
second recommendation

905
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,000
detach the discussion from the tools

906
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,760
sometimes they go into a meeting and

907
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,200
then the first question they're talking

908
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,240
about uh

909
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,919
are you doing with with this tool or

910
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,520
with these other things

911
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
please try to detach the discussion from

912
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,520
the tools try to have some uh

913
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
conceptual uh really thinking on the

914
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,719
concept and of course no don't reinvent

915
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,000
the weird there is there are some

916
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,119
sources

917
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
ask experts also to support you there

918
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,040
are not so many experts also but you

919
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,280
know there are experts even people with

920
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,239
a good understanding of mbsc uh can help

921
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,399
you okay it's better than

922
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,480
not having anybody and try to

923
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,560
reinvent the concept from scratch and

924
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,239
then a third recommendation i would like

925
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,440
to give

926
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,239
create a framework okay so really know

927
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
exactly

928
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,679
what are you doing and which category

929
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,440
your topic is

930
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,760
part of it are you working on process

931
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,040
are you working on methods are you

932
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,399
working on full

933
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
tool chain customization are you doing a

934
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800
proof concept to get a feedback

935
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
about the methodology or to test

936
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,240
something about it to clarify the

937
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,280
framework

938
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
and this is more marketing so i like to

939
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
mention that but it's important

940
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,839
uh today we leave a social network area

941
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,119
right so and we have concept of hashtags

942
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,480
so i want that mbple in airbus becomes a

943
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,800
nation so one that really people use it

944
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
as uh

945
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,079
i sometimes i hear people talking about

946
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,520
mvp now

947
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,440
and so good but even they don't know

948
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,960
what it is okay so it's important

949
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,640
sometimes that people talk about it

950
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
within the organization

951
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,640
and you create somehow this height you

952
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,240
know that people talk about it because

953
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
you start to see everywhere and be fair

954
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,480
then the understanding will come okay

955
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,079
but sometimes it's also good to create

956
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,680
this momentum especially in big

957
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,920
