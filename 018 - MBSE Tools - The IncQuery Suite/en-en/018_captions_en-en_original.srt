1
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,199
welcome to a new episode of our mbse

2
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,840
podcast today's episode

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
comes again from our series on

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
mbs

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
and we are not looking at a standard

6
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
system modeling tool but at the ink very

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
sweet from inquiry labs

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,759
we will talk about the tool in the first

9
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,159
part of the episode and look at it in a

10
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,400
demo in the second part so for all your

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
only listeners it means that the second

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,040
part might be difficult to follow the

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,439
podcast without the video

14
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,159
today we have two great guests with us

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
eastbound from inquiry and enrique from

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
zuken so

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
let's start with the introduction so

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
please introduce yourself let's start

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
with eastbound welcome

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,119
welcome thank you very much for having

21
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,479
me and having us today i really

22
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
appreciate that

23
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,680
my name is ishnarat i'm the ceo of

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,079
inquiry labs

25
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,079
the digital thread analytics company has

26
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,560
been uh call it nowadays but many of our

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
listeners maybe know us from the mbsc

28
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
world as a provider for customized tool

29
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
solutions around various mbsc tools and

30
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,680
tool chains

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
and csml in general

32
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
and obviously i'm here today to talk

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
about our flagship product the inquiry

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
suite

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
all right i am enrique kursmalnik i

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
think that might be the first time many

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
of you have actually heard me pronounce

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
my last name

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,360
i usually just go by enrique

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
um i'm currently the ceo of vitek vitec

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
is a company that was acquired by

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
zuken in august of 2019

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
and i think many of the listeners might

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,319
be familiar with vitek as being the

45
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,280
originators and developers of core

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
which has now been succeeded by genesis

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,720
which is the new modeling platform from

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
vitek

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
and uh of course i know tim and

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
christian and ishvan from my

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
previous role as cto of no magic so i'm

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
very excited to be here um excited to be

53
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
talking about mbsc and excited to be

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
showing some of the work

55
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
that uh ishvan and i have been working

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
together uh working on together for the

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
last six months or so

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,599
yeah great very nice to have too so yeah

59
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,800
so to say long-term experts on mvc here

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
on the podcast

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
um yeah

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,480
as we already discovered you're from two

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,920
different companies and um maybe you can

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,080
tell our listeners um

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
what's the relationship between inquiry

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
and zukin or why tech

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
well i think that's a great place to

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,599
start

69
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,560
um so as i mentioned zuken acquired

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,599
vitek

71
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
in 2019 and zuken for those of you who

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
don't know

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
is an international company

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
headquartered in yokohama japan

75
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,000
known for its ecad tools specifically

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
around pc board design wire harness etc

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,439
and zuken realized a while back

78
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
that it was important to start moving

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
upstream couldn't continue to just be a

80
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
detailed design company focus on

81
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,879
electrical and electronic design

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
um the

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,759
correlation and the connection between

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
ecad electrical design and

85
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
mbse specifically because so many

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
complex systems today are dependent on

87
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
electrical electronic

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
execution of behaviors and software

89
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,440
that's

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
deployed through ecu's

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
they're inextricably connected right

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
so

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
being able to move upstream to the

94
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
architecture and that top-down design

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
was very important to zuken

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
hence the acquisition so there are

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
really two dimensions to to the work

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
that's that's been done

99
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,160
um

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
zuken

101
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,720
sees the the streamlining of that

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,199
transition from architecture to detail

103
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,039
design as a critical

104
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,320
enabler

105
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
for successful development of products

106
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,440
right now as we know uh mbsc and systems

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
engineering unfortunately

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,199
function

109
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
as a silo in many cases

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
and and that's problematic it's

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
problematic for organizations because

112
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
they can't really realize the the

113
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
potential roi

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
that mba and not just mbsc but the whole

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
digitalization

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
this whole transformation can deliver

117
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
so one aspect is this streamlining of

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
that transition from architecture to

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
detail design

120
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,240
but the second aspect of this

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
is and this is really driven by by vitec

122
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
is a belief that it is open and

123
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,840
connected

124
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
ecosystems that need to drive

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,759
these digital engineering strategies in

126
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,360
these digital engineering platforms

127
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
smaller companies like inquiry labs

128
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,000
are companies that often drive a lot of

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
the innovation

130
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,360
in industries

131
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
and

132
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
we as zooken we as vitec want to help

133
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
enable that

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
we see these collaborative partnerships

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
as really bringing new ideas and new

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
technologies to the market

137
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
and you know these

138
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
providing these open connected vendor

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
neutral and i

140
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
you know it's hard to say vendor neutral

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
because as you know it's hard to support

142
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,840
everything out there but as vendor

143
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
neutral as one can be

144
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
you know the idea being that we want

145
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
companies to be able to select their

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
tool chain

147
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
find the tools that they believe are

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
best of breed and that best fit their

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
needs

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and build that digital solution on those

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,759
tools um so the partnership was was

152
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
really a natural and uh the

153
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
conversations have been

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
very natural and

155
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
they were driven really by this

156
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000
lightweight bridge that zuken developed

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
to connect genesis to

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
the the wire harness tool

159
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
and having had you know a previous

160
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
relationship with with ishvan and his

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
company

162
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
i saw them as being a

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
a partner that could really help tie

164
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,599
this together for us

165
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
so i know it was a long answer but i

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
think there was a lot to share in that

167
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,840
absolutely

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,919
the lightweight bridge between

169
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
e3 and the genesis the lightweight

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
bridge is a part of the inquiry suite

171
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,840
then

172
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
no it is not part of the it's not part

173
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
of the inquiry suite it is actually a

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
product that is

175
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,080
that has been developed and is marketed

176
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
by zukin us

177
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
okay so and welcome the inquiry speed

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
then into the game

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
so the inquiry suite is a layer that

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
sits on top of that so the bridge itself

181
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
what it does is it exposes a design

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,199
envelope

183
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,280
you can think of this as

184
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
you know the the information needed by

185
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
the electrical engineer to do their job

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
so we provide in this design envelope

187
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
you know diagrams requirements um

188
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
verification requirements test

189
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
configurations

190
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,599
all done through a viewpoint so the

191
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,319
systems engineer

192
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,039
doesn't have to do anything that special

193
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,319
other than

194
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
you know i'll i'll make this analogous

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,240
to to the sysml world it's basically

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
adding some stereotypes right so

197
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
you you um

198
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,640
you make sure

199
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
as a systems engineer that you indicate

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,800
what

201
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,959
signals are electrical signals

202
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
what components

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
are electrical components are

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
participating in an electrical system

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,080
so

206
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
basically just like stereotyping

207
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
and

208
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
through this process we're able to

209
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
extract this viewpoint that is then

210
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
consumed by the electrical engineer

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
and is used to prime that initial

212
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
electrical design

213
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
in the process of priming that design

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
and bringing information over from

215
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
genesis into e3 we begin to create that

216
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
traceability that that connection

217
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,839
right

218
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
but that wasn't enough

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
right that's only part of the process

220
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,800
we have to ensure that what's brought

221
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
over

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
is then worked on in a way that that

223
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
delivers a complete design because we

224
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
can't bring

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,320
a detailed design over when

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
in its entirety when we're doing

227
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,800
something that's at a high abstract

228
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
level right we're only providing

229
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,880
guidance and knowledge and

230
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
specifications for what needs to be done

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
but there's still a lot of work that the

232
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
electrical engineer has to do

233
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,920
so the idea behind this is to make sure

234
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
that as the electrical engineer

235
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
does it does his or her job as they are

236
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
iterating on this that we have a way to

237
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
automatically check

238
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
the the quality of the model and make

239
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,720
sure that

240
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,079
that what is defined in that

241
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
specification is reflected

242
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
in the detailed design right if a

243
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
component exists in the architecture it

244
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
should exist in the detailed design

245
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
if there's a connection

246
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,440
it should exist

247
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
if there's a signal it should be

248
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,480
allocated to some sort of wire somewhere

249
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
right so we run all of these checks to

250
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
ensure that what we've

251
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
specified

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
is complete and consistent and correct

253
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,040
on the

254
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
design side iterating that means this

255
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,040
bridge works in both directions so it's

256
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
not only that you push information from

257
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
genesis to e3 but also in the other

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,399
direction

259
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
there is information that goes in the

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
other direction

261
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,720
so the electrical engineer is able to

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
provide feedback

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
uh for example on on requirements and

264
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
verification testing

265
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,079
that would go back to the model exactly

266
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,440
exactly and it's a good point tim

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
because one of the one of the problems

268
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
we have today is not just that this

269
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
process of transitioning from

270
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
architecture to detailed design is is

271
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,560
disconnected

272
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,160
as a result of that the model becomes

273
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
irrelevant right the model

274
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
doesn't matter anymore and the detailed

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
design continues to evolve

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
without any reference back to the

277
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
original architecture

278
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,279
so this gives a way to bring that back

279
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
that feedback back into the model so yes

280
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
it is actually

281
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
it is actually a two-way connection and

282
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,120
i guess

283
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
electronics and software are also

284
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
tightly connected very often and i saw

285
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
that

286
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,959
inquiry suit also offers alm

287
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,680
connectors and so on

288
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,639
so

289
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
i think we will

290
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,120
see some more information now in in the

291
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
demo so you

292
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
prepared something for us

293
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
yes actually that's the plan so so

294
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
actually the

295
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
the this integration with with zukan uh

296
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
e3 and wi-tech genesis is something that

297
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
we covered the uh in some talks earlier

298
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
this year uh first i think at the

299
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
western states regional conference and

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
then later at the models industry tracks

301
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
and obviously i'm going to show you the

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
the

303
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
relevant part of the demos today but for

304
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
today we prepared an

305
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
extended significantly extended

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,360
demonstration that showcases some other

307
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
capabilities of the inquiry suite and

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
puts you know some of the things that

309
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
you may have seen earlier into a bigger

310
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
and broader context

311
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,519
actually we are going to to be using

312
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
a different set of tools

313
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
for that part focusing on sysaml and and

314
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
requirements management in in jira so

315
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,560
yes the demo is going to be

316
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
much more than what you have seen

317
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,480
previously

318
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
dean if you were wondering how committed

319
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
zukin and vitek are to open ecosystems

320
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
there you go right we're we're gonna be

321
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
the the core of the demonstration today

322
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
will actually be with with other tools

323
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
and i think that's great because

324
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
you know environments aren't completely

325
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
homogeneous today yeah

326
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
right so

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
we we need to provide

328
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
rich connectivity and foundations for

329
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
organizations to build these

330
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,360
digital ecosystems

331
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
and uh is you mentioned in the beginning

332
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,639
that uh inkberry is is the digital

333
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
thread company i think you named it like

334
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
that yes and the term digital effect is

335
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
used very often and very

336
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,399
differently

337
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
so

338
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,079
what's the digital thread for for you

339
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
and uh i am i think i use the term the

340
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
digital thread analytics which is

341
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
something a little bit more specific

342
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,199
than just a digital thread obviously

343
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,360
the digital thread i think is it's uh

344
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
probably a term that is more used in the

345
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
u.s uh rather than over here in europe

346
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
but it's basically to me

347
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
expresses the idea that

348
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
all the engineering data that we all

349
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
work with in various processes

350
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
is not you know a collection of isolated

351
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,240
uh artifacts uh you know that that are

352
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,680
somehow uh just connected loosely in our

353
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
heads uh some way right but they should

354
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
be part

355
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,680
of the digital thread something that is

356
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
tangible

357
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
in technological terms

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
that that actually provides this

359
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
end-to-end traceability across all the

360
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
different artifacts that need to be

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
connected in an engineering process

362
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
for the purpose of

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
you know providing navigability going

364
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,120
from tool to tool in a seamless way

365
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
integrating the tools to each other

366
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
being able to generate at least part of

367
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,800
the documentation which is very

368
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
important especially in safety critical

369
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
design processes

370
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,199
and also helping on board

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,519
new engineers to an organization which

372
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
is a very important added value i think

373
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
of modern tools especially

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
that you know these very complex

375
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,600
engineering disciplines become more

376
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,760
accessible so this is the digital thread

377
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
part of the answer and what

378
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,399
our technology can provide as an added

379
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
value to all of this is the analytics

380
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,519
part right

381
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,079
and of course nowadays data analytics

382
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,600
and data science in general are

383
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
extremely popular and have an extremely

384
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
high impact of industrial and

385
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,399
academically

386
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,680
and we want to

387
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
what we want to achieve with our tool is

388
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
to bring the results of all of the

389
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,759
these uh these innovations to the

390
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
digital engineering domain

391
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,120
to

392
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
engineers

393
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,120
the team leads and then

394
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
architects to take advantage of uh

395
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,399
powerful capabilities for the purpose of

396
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
quality assurance maintaining the

397
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
quality of the model of

398
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
in the digital thread and also for

399
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
facilitating automated tool integration

400
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
and many other interesting features so

401
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
this is what we

402
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,399
envision has to be the future of of

403
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,759
engineering tools

404
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
so that's a little bit like like the

405
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,959
compiler of the

406
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
the engineering data

407
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
i think that's that's often missing in

408
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,079
mbse

409
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,360
great models

410
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
but nobody really checks if

411
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
it really works but it's like

412
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,199
programming without running the compiler

413
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
yes yes you could you could you could

414
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
use this analogy i think that's a good

415
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
one

416
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
okay

417
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
and um

418
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,519
this is your tool then i think we will

419
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,519
see that later in the demo but is your

420
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
tool

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
uh visible for the engineer

422
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,839
this is something that works in the

423
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,040
background

424
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
of course i have actually i think and so

425
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,199
but but if i work with an mbse tool with

426
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
genesis and with e3 have also worked

427
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
with uh inquiry suite

428
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,680
then

429
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
yes the answer to this question as with

430
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
all good questions is a yes and a no at

431
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,199
the same time depending on your context

432
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
so originally originally where we

433
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
started this you know developing this

434
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
product

435
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
it was originally intended to be

436
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,679
something which is in the background so

437
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
something that is not necessarily

438
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,439
visible directly to the end user for the

439
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
systems engineer but as a service to a

440
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
tool vendor or a tool integrator inside

441
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
an organization

442
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,799
to to to provide additional value-added

443
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
services on top right

444
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
maybe for the purpose of integrating

445
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
certain tools together or adding

446
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
very desirable features to

447
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
popular modeling platforms such as

448
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,679
the ability of being able to search

449
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
inside the teamwork cloud repository for

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
instance right so this was the original

451
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
idea

452
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
but once we once we started building

453
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
this and talking to vendors and

454
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
potential customers we realized that

455
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
there is actually quite tangible and

456
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,039
high demand on the customer side

457
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,160
for directly integrating and interacting

458
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
with such features

459
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
uh mostly because

460
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,120
you know as

461
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,480
there is a large degree of heterogeneity

462
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
among the tools that are using organ is

463
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,559
it

464
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,280
there's a design i mean every organ

465
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
to try to own actually own

466
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,039
uh their data rather than having it just

467
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,400
inside uh various engineering tools and

468
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
able to do

469
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
uh we did things that the original

470
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
vendors have never even imagined that

471
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
would be meaningful and useful to the

472
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
end user right

473
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
and that's why what we once we started

474
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,039
doing about two years ago is to develop

475
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,120
the inquiry suite into

476
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,039
not just an enabler technology or a kind

477
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,400
of a middleware

478
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
but also an end user product that can

479
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
cater to

480
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,919
various audiences originally

481
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
expert audiences so people who not just

482
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
understand the modeling and mbsc but

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
also can write a database query for

484
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,120
example but as you will see in the demo

485
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
gradually as we progress with the

486
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
development of this product we are more

487
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
and more

488
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
approaching the level that we can

489
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
provide value-added and easy-to-use

490
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
features

491
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,240
out of the box essentially for systems

492
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
engineers or people who are in charge of

493
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
reviewing the work and integrating the

494
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
work of systems

495
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,559
yeah

496
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,760
i was wondering uh why there was no plm

497
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
tool on the list of your connectors

498
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
right now maybe you already have

499
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
connectors for in in the case of some

500
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
customers

501
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,679
um but you are really focusing at the

502
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
moment so that's my point of view on

503
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
systems engineering

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
as a single domain and then

505
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
now the

506
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,799
step in in direction to

507
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,640
eda ecat

508
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
and alm

509
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
yeah yeah so so inquiry suite is a very

510
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,280
new product in fact i would say that

511
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
that uh that it's uh

512
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
it's it's at its current stage it's it's

513
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
still in a kind of a pile of uh face

514
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,480
majority of our customers but it's

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,280
developed at a quite rapid pace and

516
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
one of the one of the consequences of

517
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
this is that the connectors that we

518
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
offer are expanding also

519
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,120
basically from quarter to quarter at the

520
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
moment i think we have connectors in

521
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,080
five

522
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
categories systems engineering tools

523
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
such as cameo

524
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,159
and we are working on one for enterprise

525
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,520
architect

526
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,240
uh the second one is uh um

527
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
actually i would say al and pln2 so the

528
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,200
likes of uh jama for example

529
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
can

530
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,919
be as a such a tool in in the way and we

531
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
are working on connector tools like

532
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
polarion for example

533
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,559
the third one is a documentation

534
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
platform like confluence or

535
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,679
mbe in a certain way i think it can be

536
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,360
regarded as well you know with the view

537
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
editor and stuff like that

538
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,400
and jupiter of course the fourth one is

539
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,960
simulation tools like modelling which is

540
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
a very nice modern web-based tool for

541
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
working with modelica simulations

542
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
and the fifth one at the moment on our

543
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
focus is ecad and and this also ties

544
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
back into your first question which i

545
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,360
wanted to uh reflect on why the

546
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
partnership with vitek and zulkin is of

547
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,039
particular interest to us and the reason

548
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
for this is that we have found that ecad

549
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,159
is actually

550
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
one of the most frequently used

551
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,559
tools together with mbsc at least

552
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
looking at our customer base and there

553
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,360
is actually a quite a

554
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,480
tangible demand for for integrating ecat

555
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
tools better with mbsc tools because mbs

556
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
suppose to my surprise

557
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
actually i'm coming you know originally

558
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
from the model driven software

559
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
engineering world as many of my

560
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
colleagues they know

561
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
is that mbsc tools are actually used for

562
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,039
hardware design quite quite

563
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,280
substantially so so that's the reason

564
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
why we are particularly interested in

565
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,679
ecad as well

566
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,679
interesting

567
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
i think you mentioned or

568
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,120
i saw on your website that

569
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
the ink very sweet

570
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,880
creates a knowledge graph so so the

571
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
digital thread is stored in the

572
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
knowledge graph so what actually is is

573
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
stored

574
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
then in inquiry street now if we have e3

575
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,600
there's the the e-card stuff and genesis

576
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
has three mvse stuff and what is stored

577
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
in

578
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,559
inquiry then

579
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,640
yeah so the fundamental idea of of

580
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
analytics in our case our approach to

581
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,559
managing the digital thread in this

582
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,400
knowledge graph is

583
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,520
that that uh that we don't intend to

584
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
replace any of the engineering tools

585
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,080
rather we want to augment them right so

586
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
the users

587
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,159
work as they did before with whatever

588
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,640
tools they want to work with or whatever

589
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
tools they have already available

590
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
but using our connectors

591
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,559
the data

592
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,679
can be um let's say

593
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
um

594
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
extracted from these engineering tools

595
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
in a scalable

596
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
important

597
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,919
thing is

598
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,600
to this unified and the common uh

599
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
representation which we call the

600
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
knowledge graph and conceptually

601
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,120
this is really a graph like

602
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,880
maybe in technical terms i would even

603
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
call it a property graph you know so

604
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,799
nodes and edges and attributes and

605
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
whatever and this is then stored

606
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
in our own

607
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,159
database actually collection of

608
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,640
databases at the same time because the

609
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
unique uh let's say design principle of

610
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,799
the inquiry suit is what i call

611
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
redundancy by design which means that we

612
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
not only store this data in one

613
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,919
particular format but actually three or

614
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
four or even more depending on the use

615
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,039
cases because what we have found is that

616
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,720
in

617
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
in reality the

618
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
what you actually want to do with this

619
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
data whether you want to use it for

620
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
numerical analysis purposes or tool

621
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
integration purposes is just validation

622
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,440
purposes

623
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
is a different kind of representation

624
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,039
which can provide the optimal

625
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
performance and scalability for that

626
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,679
scenario so that's why the inquiry suit

627
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,720
is really

628
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,039
technically speaking an epl engine of

629
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,720
some of some sort so an extra

630
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
transformer load

631
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,120
which is able to to use this engineering

632
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
data that is coming from the stores and

633
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
put it into various scalable cloud ready

634
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
back-end storages and then do

635
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
interesting things on on top of this

636
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,520
these representations um and and at its

637
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
core the inquiries would also provides a

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
set of apis open apis in fact

639
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
you know accessible through rest uh full

640
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,159
interfaces with open uh web tools

641
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
to access uh the contents of the

642
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,400
knowledge graph travels or process the

643
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,720
contents of the knowledge graph and also

644
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
you know do interesting things with that

645
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
so run queries on it or an analysis on

646
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,000
it

647
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
or or

648
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
basically other things as well so this

649
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
is the core core engine of the

650
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
technology

651
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
but those interesting things are

652
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
important

653
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,880
yes

654
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
it's the interesting things which the

655
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,960
users will then find useful not just you

656
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
know being able to access the data even

657
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
though i think from a from an

658
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,600
organization's point of view or someone

659
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,960
who is working inside an organization on

660
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
managing and integrating a tool chain

661
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
even just the fact

662
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,799
to be able to to access the data which

663
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,279
was previously only

664
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
possible in a in a proprietary

665
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,200
i think it's

666
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,039
people very well

667
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
in many cases

668
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
enrique maybe another question for you

669
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,679
so

670
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
many people are connecting the company

671
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,960
of vitec to the name of david long so

672
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,520
what did they say to to this corporation

673
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
and then to the

674
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
all the software stuff you are doing now

675
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,120
well you know david is is very committed

676
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,799
to this concept of an open ecosystem

677
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,760
and really believes that

678
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,320
you know we need to break out of this

679
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
scenario where

680
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
systems engineering has been so siloed

681
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
for so many years

682
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
um so you know

683
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,120
we talk about this regularly obviously

684
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,200
over the last two months

685
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
since i joined vitek

686
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,919
but

687
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
he's he he very much

688
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
likes what he has seen with this

689
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,080
um because it does add that

690
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
that layer of of semantic richness

691
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,159
and to to the

692
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,039
full

693
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,159
digital thread right it's not just about

694
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,720
creating these links anymore it's not

695
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
just about knowing what the relation

696
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
that the relationship exists

697
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
it's about understanding what's inside

698
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,520
of that relationship that's important

699
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
and we know as a company

700
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
we can't solve everyone's problem by

701
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
ourselves

702
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
right we're really good

703
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,440
at that

704
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,919
that behavioral description we're really

705
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,720
good

706
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,520
at the upper left side of the v we're

707
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
really good at that stuff

708
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
we don't claim to be nor do we want to

709
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,320
be a plm company or a digital threat

710
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,480
analytics company but we want what we

711
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
want to do

712
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,399
is provide that connectivity and expose

713
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,399
the data that's needed

714
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
so that companies like inquiry labs and

715
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,000
other partners

716
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,679
can leverage that so we can really

717
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
provide the solutions that people are

718
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,000
looking for in the market

719
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,039
so could you also say

720
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,840
through a tool like inquiry

721
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,880
labs

722
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
you can or very suit

723
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
um you can really bring

724
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
the systems engineering

725
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
process which tells us the iso 5288 and

726
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,840
so on

727
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
to bring that really to life and to

728
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
digitalize this one

729
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
i think that's a really good observation

730
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,279
and it it's consistent with a lot of the

731
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,240
conversations that we have internally

732
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,279
um you know at zukin at vitec and

733
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,840
conversations we've had with with ishman

734
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,039
that

735
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,360
this is about the process it's about the

736
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
engineering process it's about the

737
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
workflow we have to consider who needs

738
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,039
to consume data where

739
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,840
we're too focused sometimes on on the

740
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,159
technology as you know

741
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,559
and not focused enough on really

742
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,120
enabling the work

743
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
and at the end of the day

744
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
it's the work that gets these products

745
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
done

746
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
um so bringing that to life i think is a

747
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,240
really astute observation

748
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,600
can we use that for our marketing are

749
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,559
you okay

750
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,080
i'm okay with that

751
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,240
okay

752
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,399
so if you connect many models and tools

753
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,399
i think you it's important for you to

754
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,039
rely on some some standards so are there

755
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,600
some standards uh used by inquiry or

756
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,080
research yes

757
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,640
yes of course of course so so there are

758
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
i think that the standards that we rely

759
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
on are basically on two levels

760
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,120
rely on a lot of technical standards

761
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,240
which are not

762
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,559
uh necessarily uh you know the euro

763
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,320
standards but maybe defacto standards in

764
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,200
the web-based engineering world such as

765
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
uh you know swagger and open api and

766
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
many other related things like oidc so

767
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,320
open id connect for example which is the

768
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
way that you authenticate and authorize

769
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,840
yourself when you log into the inquiry

770
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,799
suite

771
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,679
but we also make extensive use of omg

772
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,919
standards for example for enabling

773
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,679
various systems engineering use cases

774
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,200
right so we have

775
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
obviously a quite high level of support

776
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,360
for uml csml

777
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
um and and all the the various domain

778
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,240
specific profiles uh based on these

779
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
languages you know like the application

780
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,679
frameworks and

781
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,880
which are relevant in the bod context uh

782
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
for instance

783
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,679
and of course

784
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,000
one of the one of the core features of

785
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
the inquiry model analyzer which is a

786
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,399
solution uh as a part of the inquiry

787
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,679
suite is to to to be able to perform

788
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,600
scalable you know syntactic and and and

789
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,640
structural validation of system l models

790
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,399
for example against

791
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,799
the these rules which are included in

792
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,279
this standard so that's basically one of

793
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,000
the core features

794
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,159
yeah speaking of the features um we have

795
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,159
already talked for around 30 minutes so

796
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,480
let's let's have a look into the tool oh

797
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,039
yeah yeah

798
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
i really didn't see it

799
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,039
yeah i also know all these um

800
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,559
some screenshots from the website and

801
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,510
considered an early christmas gift

802
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,210
[Laughter]

803
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
ishvan you are muted yeah i know i know

804
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
so we should start with the original

805
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
we should start with the original

806
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,480
example like the first one this this e3

807
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
genesis connector and i will let enrique

808
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,000
narrate this one

809
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,960
yeah so you know as i mentioned earlier

810
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,360
that transition from

811
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
from architecture to detail design is

812
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,120
very painful for most organizations

813
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,120
over the last six years as i've worked

814
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,720
with different companies

815
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,039
i've seen many companies show a lot of

816
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,600
success and a lot of

817
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
maturity in that upper left part of the

818
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
v

819
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,720
but

820
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,600
moving down to that detailed design

821
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,640
is is a very painful process for

822
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
most of the organizations i've i've

823
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,440
engaged with over the last six years

824
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
so

825
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,519
if we want to

826
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,640
move to the next slide

827
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
so this is a quick video

828
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,919
that is showing genesis it's a simple

829
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,519
drone model

830
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,559
and as we in introspect this model we

831
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,080
will see that it's very simple it's just

832
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,440
an example it has two components

833
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,880
you know a link and an item or a signal

834
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,919
that's being sent across that link

835
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,200
there are also these these two

836
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
components have have types assigned to

837
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,240
them so power electronics and type ecu

838
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,159
and that signal that we referenced

839
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,679
earlier there are actually two signals

840
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,399
battery voltage positive and negative

841
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,399
so now what we're looking at is e3 this

842
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
is the actual wire harness tool and that

843
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
little box that popped up

844
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
is the interface for the connector

845
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,279
so the electrical engineer actually

846
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,440
browses the model repository directly

847
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,559
finds

848
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,240
the part of the project they're looking

849
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,200
for

850
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
and actually loads it straight into

851
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the topology diagram where we already

852
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,039
have an existing mechanical drawing

853
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
right so now the electrical engineer can

854
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,080
start doing their work laying out

855
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,279
components

856
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,200
and where you see that dashed line that

857
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
means that there's

858
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,559
there's a a

859
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
signal but nothing defined yet to carry

860
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
it so the electrical engineer starts to

861
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,840
create that

862
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
and now what you're going to see is that

863
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,519
two-way link

864
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,799
where we're actually going to

865
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,000
cross-check

866
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
that

867
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,360
that component we saw in the model is

868
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
that wire in the diagram

869
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,039
so it's just a simple example to show

870
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,000
how we bring that over

871
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,399
how simple it is it is designed

872
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,880
primarily for the electrical engineer

873
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
what you didn't see in there native uh

874
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
right now is that

875
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,880
all of the information related to

876
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
to requirements and other diagrams that

877
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,919
help the engineer understand the context

878
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,120
of what they're working and that's

879
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,519
included in this design envelope that's

880
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,640
provided

881
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
um so of course this is a first gen

882
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
first generation the electrical engineer

883
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,079
can access the the requirements that are

884
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
connected to the

885
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,520
uh

886
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
uh system element or wasn't wasn't

887
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
systematic it was uh

888
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,199
the white core language

889
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
yeah yeah so they they can see

890
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,199
all the requirements that are related

891
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,119
to the

892
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,760
the elements needed

893
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,040
to realize their design

894
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,119
okay so maybe i will take over for this

895
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,119
particular slider because this is a this

896
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,399
is not a dumbbell yet it's just a

897
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,480
screenshot and you will see similar ones

898
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
in the demo later on

899
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,960
so so the the thing that we developed in

900
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,520
connection with this connector is is a

901
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
is an analysis uh

902
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,839
let's say rule set that you can run in

903
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
the inquiry model analyzer

904
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,359
which is useful for doing something that

905
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,000
we call the so-called 3c analysis 3c

906
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,079
stands for correctness completeness and

907
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
consistency

908
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
and this kind of analysis over the

909
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,040
digital thread

910
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,680
is special because it doesn't look into

911
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
one particular artifact only so it

912
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,240
doesn't just look into the vitec systems

913
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,760
engineering model

914
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,880
or the e3 ecad model but it looks into

915
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
the combination of these models so it

916
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,720
looks looks at both of them

917
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
at the same time and also between the

918
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,800
traceability links and these models

919
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
which is created by this genesis e3

920
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
connector

921
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,359
and what it looks for is

922
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,640
weather

923
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,880
during this transition phase the

924
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
engineer

925
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,359
engineering team

926
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,359
could maintain the correctness

927
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,760
completeness constancy of the mapping

928
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
obviously

929
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,839
the

930
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,720
correctness and the completeness is more

931
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,440
down to the automated connector in this

932
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,480
sense so when we run this analysis what

933
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,640
we will see is that the completeness is

934
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,760
pretty good meaning that a large part of

935
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,160
the original systems engineering model

936
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,400
has captured in genesis was actually

937
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,640
successfully mapped or represented on

938
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
the eca side it's not complete because

939
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
as you could see in the demonstration

940
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,880
the engineer actually checked the tick

941
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,320
mark

942
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,040
unselecting one particular

943
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
component from the original model and

944
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,079
that's why we only have a partial

945
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,599
mapping here

946
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,640
but what is more interesting i think

947
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,599
from analysis point of view is that it

948
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,839
reports

949
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,680
inconsistencies on the electrical

950
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
engineering side the reason for this

951
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
inconsistencies are that there are

952
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
things that

953
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,599
are not present actually in the systems

954
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,119
engineering model and it cannot be

955
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,040
processed and and created by this

956
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,119
connector automatically which is

957
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,119
essentially related to

958
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,280
the wiring information that is specific

959
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
to the electrical engineering domain so

960
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,760
the the corresponding findings rule

961
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
findings which you see on the right side

962
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
of the screenshot

963
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,079
tell the electrical engineers that you

964
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,920
need to look into your ecat model

965
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
because there is work to be done

966
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,280
you need to create wiring information so

967
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
that your electrical engineering design

968
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,800
model become consistent with the high

969
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
level information transfer that is

970
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,560
expressed on the systems engineering

971
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,440
side okay so this is the the basic added

972
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,240
value of the 3c analysis over

973
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
such a transitionary scenario that we

974
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,240
can make the electrical engineer aware

975
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,400
that what they are working on what they

976
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,160
have in their own workspace is not

977
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,560
consistent with an upstream artifact the

978
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
systems engineering model okay and this

979
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
is possible without

980
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,440
making the electrical engineer actually

981
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,560
open you know uh vitek genesis and have

982
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,480
a look at the model themselves this is

983
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,119
the power of digital threat analytics

984
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,320
right so so um basically

985
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,720
propagating this very important quality

986
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
related information across an

987
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,119
engineering tomb team who work at

988
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,040
different stages of the remodel

989
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,359
the next one is a

990
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,160
i think for enrique

991
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,720
i'll have to see if i remember this one

992
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,400
[Laughter]

993
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,079
well what happens here is basically

994
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,000
realizing this the electrical engineer

995
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,560
then it's to create the wiring diagram

996
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,680
yeah so

997
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,599
yeah so it's taking the information that

998
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,079
was primed into the

999
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,880
into e3 and now the detailed work is

1000
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
starting to happen

1001
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,760
yeah right so now we're getting to the

1002
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,400
point where there's not just a connector

1003
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,359
and a a harness but now individual wires

1004
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,280
and pins

1005
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
right so we need to know that that

1006
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
signal

1007
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
has a wire and that there are there's an

1008
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,839
actual complete connector for it

1009
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,000
so i mean that that's what we do on the

1010
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,440
detailed design side that isn't

1011
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,520
necessarily reflected in the higher

1012
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
level model right the higher level model

1013
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,320
we know there's a link

1014
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,640
but we don't necessarily know how many

1015
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
wires make up that connector or what the

1016
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,920
end points what type of connector it is

1017
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,520
but we do have to make sure that if

1018
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,240
there's a critical signal or an item

1019
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,960
that needs to go across that signal path

1020
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,359
that it is accounted for in a correct

1021
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,240
way and in a consistent way

1022
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
yes and once this is done once this is

1023
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
done

1024
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,440
then the electrical engineer

1025
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,000
you know saves their work

1026
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,079
in some after some background

1027
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,320
processing you know the new version of

1028
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,280
this electrical design is going to be

1029
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,680
pulled into this digital uh thread the

1030
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
knowledge graph we can then rerun the

1031
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,359
analysis and then find

1032
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,280
that because of what has been created in

1033
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,800
the previous sequence now there is one

1034
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
less pair of rule violations so the

1035
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,760
overall quality of this model of models

1036
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,680
has been improved because this

1037
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,960
consistency problem or one let's say

1038
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,640
instance of the consistency problems

1039
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,800
that existed between the high level

1040
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,319
artifact and the detailed design

1041
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,040
artifact has been successfully

1042
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,520
resolved so this is a very basic

1043
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,240
let's say use case or unit of work that

1044
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,160
the the combination of the suit and the

1045
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,920
connector can power

1046
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,880
and and what what what this can be built

1047
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,839
into

1048
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,800
is basically a project management or a

1049
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,960
quality management dashboard

1050
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
so to say which is also directly

1051
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,200
possible using the inquiries within

1052
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
various different ways

1053
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,720
that can actually act as a kind of a

1054
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,040
progress bar on a complex engineering

1055
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
process right because we can we can turn

1056
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
these

1057
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,119
reports into numbers that can power

1058
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,319
charts right uh that correspond to

1059
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,560
to what is the gap uh you know the

1060
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,040
validation gap that you have to close

1061
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
as par

1062
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,319
in preparing for a release for example

1063
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,240
of the design artifact so this chart

1064
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,720
actually shows you know as the progress

1065
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,960
of work is is going forward across

1066
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,040
various revisions in time

1067
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,880
because what is very important to know

1068
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,359
about our knowledge graph is that it's

1069
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,760
not just a snapshot of your engineering

1070
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
data

1071
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,079
but it's it continuously evolves with

1072
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,520
your work because your work is usually

1073
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,599
maintained in a version control system

1074
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,160
like you know git or timber cloud or

1075
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
some other technology in the case of of

1076
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,040
zooken tools and our connectors

1077
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,440
actually are virgin aware so they not

1078
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
only retrieve snapshots of the

1079
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
engineering data but metadata as well

1080
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,079
with versioning information which allows

1081
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,560
us to do historical analysis as well

1082
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,319
which is which is basically what is

1083
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,240
happening here under the hood

1084
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,359
okay so

1085
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,839
moving on in the demonstration uh this

1086
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,079
was the the the initial part that we

1087
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,760
have shown previously and now is the new

1088
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,079
part which i have specifically paired

1089
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,119
for today and for today uh for the

1090
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,880
demonstrating the further capabilities

1091
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,240
of the inquiry suite we are going to

1092
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,720
look at a similar scenario but something

1093
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,640
which is happening let's say one

1094
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,440
step higher in the v model again a kind

1095
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,359
of a transitional scenario but the one

1096
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,640
which happens

1097
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
between let's say the high level

1098
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,040
requirements analysis

1099
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,160
and the the you know system uh level

1100
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,079
design and the context of the

1101
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,920
demonstration is going to be a tool

1102
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,720
chain

1103
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,000
on the one hand

1104
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,880
that is consisting of you know um camera

1105
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,960
collaborator camera systems modeler and

1106
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,440
timbre cloud the tool chain

1107
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
from the magic or dassault which is i

1108
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,960
think very well known in the community

1109
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
and very well respected

1110
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,960
and in combination with these systems

1111
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
engineering tools we are going to be

1112
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,200
using confluence for the purpose of

1113
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
documentation management and maintaining

1114
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
the overall let's say knowledge base of

1115
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,359
the engineering team and the engineering

1116
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,240
process we are going to be using jira as

1117
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,520
a lightweight

1118
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,319
requirements management tool on the one

1119
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,000
hand and on the other hand also for the

1120
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,359
purpose of

1121
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,680
managing the engineering process itself

1122
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,040
so checking the tracking tasks um in in

1123
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,000
jira

1124
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,720
and we are going to connect these set of

1125
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,800
tools together using the capabilities of

1126
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,000
the inquiry suite for the purpose of

1127
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,359
checking and quality analyze

1128
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,359
the various artifacts which are found in

1129
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,880
this

1130
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,040
process and also on the other hand

1131
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
performing another kind of 3c analysis

1132
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,200
looking at the quality of model of

1133
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
models as we cross

1134
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,319
tool boundaries okay so the first demo

1135
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,760
sequence is just

1136
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,520
for you to show and get familiar with

1137
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,119
the context of the example for this

1138
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,880
particular demonstration we are going to

1139
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,520
use the forest fire detection system

1140
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,359
which is a very nicely elaborated

1141
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,520
systems engineering example

1142
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,680
uh you know incorporating many different

1143
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,880
aspects of csml as a language including

1144
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,760
you know

1145
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,960
component level design requirements

1146
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,480
many other things

1147
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,800
including very nice limit diagrams i

1148
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
think this is something which is a

1149
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,640
really good example for demonstrating

1150
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,119
the power of mbsc and mbs related tools

1151
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,440
as well here you can see this model in

1152
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,280
camera collaborator which is basically a

1153
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,440
web-based platform for showcasing the

1154
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,359
contents of a system model as an

1155
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,280
interactive and structured document that

1156
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,079
you can browse and navigate

1157
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:20,960
along

1158
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,760
you know the standard web-based user

1159
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,920
interfaces

1160
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,520
and um

1161
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
you know this model has got a lot of

1162
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
different types of documents and

1163
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,160
diagrams as well

1164
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,839
block diagrams uh use case diagrams many

1165
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,440
other things which are going to play an

1166
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
interesting role in our demonstration

1167
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,640
today

1168
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,760
in addition to this as you could see we

1169
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
had

1170
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,160
some documents in confluence here on

1171
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,839
this uh tab but we also have a jira

1172
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,839
project set up you know jira is also an

1173
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,680
atlassian tool

1174
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,240
that you can use to manage

1175
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,800
issues and and essentially these issues

1176
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,680
can either be corresponding to tasks

1177
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,520
that we have to follow on on our

1178
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
modeling project as well as

1179
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,760
requirements actually you can you can

1180
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,240
use jira for the purpose of enumerating

1181
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,440
that so

1182
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,880
basically this is the starting point for

1183
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
the context of the demonstration for

1184
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,400
today

1185
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,480
and first i'm going to show you how

1186
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,880
these tools are actually then pulled

1187
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
into this knowledge graph representation

1188
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,240
this is run through

1189
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,480
the inquiry servers workspace manager

1190
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,720
which is what we are going to engage as

1191
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,880
you can see in this demonstration

1192
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,480
basically almost all the tools of the

1193
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
inquiry suite are web-based tools so

1194
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,760
that's the reason why we see all the

1195
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,440
interaction happening in the browser

1196
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,480
window

1197
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,359
here on this interface you see workspace

1198
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
manager

1199
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,520
on the left side we can see the various

1200
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,319
data sources uh that are configured in

1201
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,000
this particular installation so as you

1202
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,040
can see we can access our confluence

1203
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,240
invert cloud instances and also the mms

1204
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,760
is here but we are not going to be using

1205
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
that for our demonstration today and on

1206
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,000
the right is what we call the workspace

1207
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,680
so that's actually the portion of the

1208
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,520
knowledge graph that our current user

1209
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,599
who is logged into the system can use

1210
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,760
and populate and this is what our user

1211
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
is actually going to do now so we are

1212
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,880
going to navigate to the forest fire

1213
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
demonstration as it's stored on finger

1214
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,440
cloud

1215
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,119
we are going to select a particular

1216
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,440
project on a branch in a particular

1217
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,680
revision so this is what i told that the

1218
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,760
connector is version aware and we are

1219
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,359
just going to add it to the workspace

1220
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,280
very quickly it's a matter of just a few

1221
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,400
seconds

1222
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,560
it's uh basically happening all the data

1223
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,640
processing in the background

1224
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
and the same thing we are going to be

1225
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,200
doing for the jira project

1226
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
add to the workspace to have this

1227
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,800
representation

1228
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,119
as part of the knowledge graph as part

1229
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
of our

1230
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,560
you know digital thread so it is very

1231
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,800
easy to to pull in

1232
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,560
various parts of you know your

1233
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,359
engineering data into this system this

1234
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,760
is one way of doing this the manual way

1235
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,520
but it's also important to emphasize

1236
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,839
that we have a way of automating this

1237
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,440
you know that it happens automatically

1238
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
in the background as revisions are

1239
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,200
checked in for instance

1240
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
now the first thing that i want to show

1241
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,480
to you is

1242
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,880
what if we just want to analyze one

1243
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
particular artifact in the digital

1244
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,760
thread so not yet across two boundaries

1245
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,960
but i just want to see if my system

1246
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,800
model is okay

1247
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,400
for this purpose we are going to be

1248
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,440
using um this information flow integrity

1249
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,280
analysis which is essentially

1250
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,359
something that i think is also described

1251
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,200
in the standards but in this particular

1252
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,400
sense we

1253
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,079
example we extended it a little bit with

1254
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,599
some custom logic

1255
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,680
it's an example of a verb from less

1256
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,160
validation rule right so

1257
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,440
we are going to look for a condition

1258
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,520
around the way information flows are

1259
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
modeled in the system model

1260
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,599
which can be a source of a problem so if

1261
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,800
there is a presence there is a match

1262
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,880
found by the analyzer that means that

1263
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,040
that's actually a quality issue that we

1264
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,960
have to address on the systems

1265
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,079
engineering level in order to do this uh

1266
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,319
the solution that we use in the inquiry

1267
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,760
suite is what we call the inquiry

1268
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,359
modalizer

1269
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,920
we use an analyst bridge to manage this

1270
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,640
automated validation analysis reports it

1271
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,319
supports the standards that i already

1272
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,119
mentioned such as system upd and uaf as

1273
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,720
well as open source libraries such as

1274
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,960
the sai digital engineering validation

1275
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
tool which is a very nice set of rules

1276
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
for doing exactly the same thing

1277
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
and it has got a standalone web-based

1278
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,559
user interface as well as a very good

1279
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,880
integration with the jupiter

1280
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,280
ecosystem that is an open source uh

1281
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
document meditation management platform

1282
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,520
originating from the data analysis

1283
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,480
community

1284
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,160
and what you are also going to be using

1285
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,079
in the demo is another solution that we

1286
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,160
call inquiry model viewer which is a

1287
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,040
generic web-based visualization tool for

1288
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
looking at the contents of the knowledge

1289
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
graph as it is stored

1290
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,480
inside the inquiry suite so in order to

1291
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,079
use this feature

1292
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,680
we are going to launch the model

1293
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,359
analyzer on this particular artifact

1294
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,280
we are going to

1295
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,440
select this custom flow integrity

1296
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,839
validation suite which is documented in

1297
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,000
the confluence as you could see in the

1298
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,920
previous example so that's where the

1299
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,720
screenshot was from this this page

1300
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
describes to the systems engineer in

1301
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,559
detail what is the logic that is being

1302
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,720
checked here and what's the relevance of

1303
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,400
such a rule and if you have found the

1304
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,640
match in the analysis core then how to

1305
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,160
resolve that match

1306
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
and once the analysis is complete you

1307
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,920
can see that we could run this analysis

1308
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,319
rather quickly even if there is 2 300 or

1309
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,400
even millions of modern elements

1310
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,480
you see a detailed uh

1311
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,839
report essentially that contains

1312
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,640
how many instances we have found for

1313
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,200
violations of a particular validation

1314
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,440
rule and for each violation you get a

1315
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,400
detailed

1316
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,280
uh

1317
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
table basically

1318
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,839
that tells the the systems engineer

1319
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,000
where exactly the model that problem

1320
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,920
resides and

1321
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
now we can actually navigate to that

1322
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,040
location using that link opening uh the

1323
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,680
model viewer focusing on that particular

1324
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,960
model element right this connector here

1325
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,359
this is this is a system model that you

1326
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,400
see in this screenshot so this is what

1327
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,800
what you would actually see inside uh

1328
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,040
magic draw or camel systems modeler or

1329
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,960
team or camel collaborator which you

1330
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,760
will see in a moment but we also see not

1331
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
just the structure of the model you know

1332
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,240
packages classes diagrams connectors

1333
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,800
properties etc but also

1334
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,559
here on the right side of the screen you

1335
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,960
can see the various attribute values for

1336
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,880
example and all the cross references

1337
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,760
which may craft structure this model

1338
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,960
okay

1339
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,760
so the modal viewer is a generic

1340
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,400
interface it's it's customized in this

1341
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
case a little bit to csml so there are

1342
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,559
filters applied for example on the left

1343
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,000
side of the screen

1344
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
but in general the same kind of user

1345
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,160
visualization applies to everything

1346
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,079
which is stored in the knowledge graph

1347
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,800
so jira you know modelling and all the

1348
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,680
other

1349
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,520
tools that we have connectors for can be

1350
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,240
visualized and open the very same way

1351
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
very quickly integrated

1352
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,400
into this suite

1353
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,319
and from here this model viewer it's

1354
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,319
also very easy to navigate back to the

1355
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,800
original tool from where the data came

1356
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,119
so from with one click of a button we

1357
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,720
can go back to

1358
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,040
camera collaborator for example

1359
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,359
in this instance to see in the original

1360
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,520
context you know where the the rule

1361
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,240
violation is coming so from so where in

1362
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,200
the system model uh it will need to be

1363
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,680
uh you know fixed at this point i think

1364
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,920
i will make a little bit of a break and

1365
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
ask if you have any questions related to

1366
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,520
all the things that i have shown so far

1367
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,359
i think it was crystal clear so far and

1368
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,800
straight on

1369
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,160
very impressive

1370
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,359
okay so let's move on uh because now i

1371
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,680
want to show you another capability that

1372
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,079
maybe a little bit slower so as you

1373
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,040
could see

1374
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,599
the modalizer analyzer is not just

1375
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,160
capable of running built-in

1376
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,920
business logic so these validation

1377
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,800
analysis rules but it also gives the

1378
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
power of running custom rules queries

1379
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,680
essentially obviously to a more advanced

1380
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,520
user okay so in this case this is the

1381
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,960
functionality that we are going to show

1382
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,079
off

1383
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,760
here

1384
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,079
i think we are going to you know it's

1385
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,000
still the same sorry so maybe this one

1386
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,319
is the best one yeah so we are going to

1387
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,800
run the model query part yes

1388
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,480
and here

1389
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,400
uh there is obviously a couple of

1390
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,000
built-in queries example

1391
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,480
the ones that are related to uh this

1392
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,040
custom flow analysis in in in this

1393
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,119
configuration of the inquiry suite there

1394
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,280
are three query languages that the user

1395
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,559
can select from

1396
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
week well sparkuel and elasticsearch

1397
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,960
elasticsearch is uh is a is a full text

1398
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,839
engine uh that has also some structural

1399
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,760
uh constraint capabilities it's very

1400
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,920
powerful in technology

1401
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,839
um spark ul is the standard

1402
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,400
query language uh based on you know

1403
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
cement uh

1404
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,800
data structures and ontologies and stuff

1405
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,280
like that and vql is very similar to

1406
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,680
spark ul but but it's coming from a

1407
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,520
different community it's coming from the

1408
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,240
the eclipse modeling community and it's

1409
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,000
also a pattern-based language so this

1410
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,559
particular rule that you have seen here

1411
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,800
is was defined in the week well language

1412
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,880
if you know there is interest i can talk

1413
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,400
about this but maybe we should focus

1414
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,559
more on the functionality so what we're

1415
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,000
going to do now as part of this

1416
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,280
demonstration is we are going to

1417
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,640
redefine

1418
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,640
uh this query which was written in the

1419
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,720
sparkvue language and redefine it into

1420
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,839
an elastic search or a losing

1421
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,760
query to look for

1422
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,680
let's say things in the system model

1423
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,480
that

1424
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,559
have the string data

1425
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,559
and something which

1426
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,119
begins with the word track

1427
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,960
in in their value so this is what this

1428
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,040
query is intended to mean you can run

1429
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
such a query freely as you could say you

1430
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
can really find it very easily and you

1431
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,000
will get

1432
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,640
results and these results again are you

1433
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,119
know corresponding to particular hits in

1434
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,200
the system model so you can run the full

1435
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,400
text search on a system model

1436
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,520
in this case it will give you a short

1437
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,559
list of those elements which are hit to

1438
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,200
this query and also show you why you

1439
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,440
know it considers this is a hit this is

1440
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,599
what is shown on the right side of this

1441
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,799
table and again even from this interface

1442
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,799
it's very easy to navigate first to the

1443
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,400
model viewer

1444
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
representation and from the model viewer

1445
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,160
again you can go to the camera

1446
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,839
collaborator or

1447
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,359
if you have that project open in your

1448
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,839
workspace too to canal systems modeler

1449
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,160
directly

1450
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,359
okay so this uh concludes uh let's say

1451
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,079
the the first part of the demonstration

1452
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,559
and if we have some more time i can also

1453
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,880
show you how we can do the the quality

1454
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,040
assurance across tool boundaries

1455
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,839
in the context of jira and csml this is

1456
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,760
also very similar

1457
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,400
to what we've been doing with you know

1458
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,119
genesis and e3 but with the combination

1459
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,280
of different tools

1460
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
and of course the three seed challenge

1461
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,599
is also valid in this particular context

1462
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,680
as well so

1463
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,599
if i use jira

1464
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,359
to to to

1465
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,359
capture all the high-level requirements

1466
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,040
that i need to process them further in

1467
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
the systems engineering design it's

1468
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,839
obviously very important capability that

1469
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,079
i want to represent these requirements

1470
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,079
i want to make sure that i get them all

1471
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,000
so i have the correctness

1472
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,680
the checkbox

1473
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,040
i want to make sure that they are mapped

1474
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,280
to correctly to properly type system

1475
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,799
structure

1476
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,760
and of course i also want to make sure

1477
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,160
looking more inside on the system side

1478
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,720
whether all the lower level requirements

1479
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,880
which i may have added on the system

1480
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,400
side whether they are properly traced

1481
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,640
back to this high level requirements

1482
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,480
so this is exactly what we are going to

1483
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,720
create as a as a validation

1484
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,599
configuration but what is an interesting

1485
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,559
twist

1486
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,880
here that in this case we are not going

1487
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,760
to rely on a bridge tool to pull in the

1488
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,720
requirements to the systems engineering

1489
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,200
artifact and instead

1490
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,160
we are going to use the native tools so

1491
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,880
jira and magic draw to establish

1492
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,640
traceability links

1493
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,359
across these tool boundaries in a very

1494
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,240
easy to use and lightweight way for the

1495
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,160
purpose of using these traceability

1496
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,799
links to power this completeness

1497
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,599
correctness and and consistency analysis

1498
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,760
so the question is how you create such

1499
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,760
lightweight traceability links

1500
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,680
and you can do this actually from both

1501
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,240
directions right so uh if you want to

1502
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,119
link uh let's say uh um

1503
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,200
sysml uh you know issue to uh uh uh

1504
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,680
i mean the jira issued a system model

1505
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,920
you just have to essentially apply a

1506
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,839
special stereotype

1507
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,040
in your model

1508
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,559
as well as add a tagged value and and of

1509
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,040
course with the corresponding value

1510
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,359
actually that will be a link

1511
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,960
with the url

1512
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,440
to the jira issue so this is one way of

1513
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,880
establishing such a lightweight

1514
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,920
connection the other way is the other

1515
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,799
direction so what if i want to

1516
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,960
establish a link from

1517
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,359
jira into a seasonal artifact i can do

1518
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,880
that one as well

1519
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,400
very easily

1520
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,720
uh hopefully i'm showing the right one

1521
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,160
so you can actually

1522
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,119
um

1523
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,440
you know use the url as you see in your

1524
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,160
address bar the browser address bar and

1525
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,799
then put this url here on the jira site

1526
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,440
like this like a simple copy paste okay

1527
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,720
and after you are done with these

1528
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,079
operations this link is established it

1529
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,240
doesn't matter really from our point of

1530
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
view whether you add the url to the

1531
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,280
system model where you add the url to

1532
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,760
the jira issue it's going to be a

1533
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,000
logical link that is going to be used

1534
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,960
for the purpose of across the analysis

1535
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,799
and the cross domain assist in this

1536
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,520
scenario is going to happen on other

1537
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,680
kind of user interface of the model line

1538
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,480
analyzer which is the jupiter framework

1539
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,160
i don't know to what degree you are

1540
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,240
familiar with jupiter it actually looks

1541
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,119
like a browser-based

1542
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,359
programming environment would there say

1543
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,359
almost but it's actually more than a

1544
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,119
programming environment because it's

1545
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,200
actually a documentation

1546
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,599
creation environment as well and the

1547
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,240
documents that you create in jupiter

1548
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,520
consist of documentation parts so

1549
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,520
things that you can format as a document

1550
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,440
and put in you know formatting and

1551
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,359
hyperlinks and images and things like

1552
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,000
this but you can also put in code

1553
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,160
snippets originally in the python

1554
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,400
language but now there is many more

1555
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,319
so-called language kernels available for

1556
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,880
jupiter so we have a python

1557
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,880
we also use jupiter for the system lv2

1558
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,599
pilot implementation yes yes so we

1559
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,079
provide we provide an open source python

1560
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,319
connectivity library for interacting

1561
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,079
with the inquiry suite that you can very

1562
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,720
easily embed in a jupyter notebook

1563
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,640
and then using this final python

1564
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,880
connectivity library you can actually

1565
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,960
take advantage of the api functionality

1566
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,799
that is exposed by the inquiry suite

1567
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,599
right so typically how such an analysis

1568
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,119
notebook looks like is that on the

1569
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,880
beginning you have to set up the

1570
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,640
connection to the inquiry suite so

1571
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,200
locate the api endpoint and provide your

1572
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,440
user credentials and things like this

1573
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
and after this is done

1574
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,440
then there are built-in widgets for

1575
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,520
selecting the particular

1576
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,599
let's say component of the digital

1577
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,359
thread that you want to work with so the

1578
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,599
workspace resource branch and revision

1579
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,680
so in this case to select the forest

1580
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,359
fire detection system

1581
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,079
and once this is done then we can use

1582
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,520
the again a built-in user interface

1583
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,280
component for

1584
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,440
configuring the so-called filter so we

1585
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,680
are going to be using a package filter

1586
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,480
in this particular scenario because we

1587
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,640
only are interested in the connectivity

1588
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,160
analysis in the context of one

1589
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,720
particular package in the system model i

1590
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,160
think this is a very frequently and

1591
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,480
often used feature by systems engineers

1592
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,319
because you're not interested in things

1593
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,400
all over the model just in one

1594
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,040
particular packaging on one particular

1595
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,839
epic in this sense and all the rest of

1596
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,680
the analysis notebook can be run fully

1597
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,960
automatically

1598
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,680
and this notebook is going to create an

1599
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,480
interactively browseable html document

1600
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,119
for you based on the forest fire

1601
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,079
detection system that contains this

1602
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,240
mapping information this corresponding

1603
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,160
correspondence analysis information

1604
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,640
between the jira

1605
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,319
let's say part of the the knowledge

1606
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,839
graph and the system part of the

1607
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,640
knowledge graph so as you can see here

1608
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,599
you can you have a list of um jira tasks

1609
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,359
that are correctly mapped to the systems

1610
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,720
engineering model

1611
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,480
and you can also see a list of the jira

1612
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,839
attacks which are unmapped to the

1613
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,520
systems engineering model so this is the

1614
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,000
fundamentals of the correctness analysis

1615
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,760
things that you have already done and

1616
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
things which are yet to be done of

1617
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,839
course in jupiter you have access to

1618
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,440
nice visualization and plotting

1619
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,200
libraries that are able to generate

1620
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,040
nicely looking diagrams as well this is

1621
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,839
all accessible very easily from this

1622
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,200
environment

1623
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,359
and the these jupiter notebooks are

1624
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,000
actually files themselves that can be

1625
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,319
stored in a version control system like

1626
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,160
a git repository

1627
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,400
and we also have a connector

1628
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,720
that allows you to process a jupiter

1629
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,240
notebook like as a part of this digital

1630
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,000
thread analysis and the knowledge graph

1631
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,720
so you can actually turn this again on

1632
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,040
on its head and use our analysis

1633
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,680
capabilities to look inside the jupiter

1634
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,480
uh

1635
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,280
okay

1636
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,720
so this is how

1637
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
this is how the 3c analysis looks like

1638
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,960
in this this environment

1639
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,200
pretty powerful so we

1640
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,680
we also filled up a whole hour with with

1641
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,880
all this stuff that's amazing

1642
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,480
great i have what questions so um

1643
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,480
which role in an engineering project

1644
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,119
will typically use your tool is it the

1645
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,480
systems engineer the requirements

1646
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,559
engineer the electrical engineer or is

1647
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,119
there a special role that

1648
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,119
the digital threat engineer that that

1649
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,559
works with the inquiry suite

1650
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,520
yes

1651
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,520
all of them all of them but this role

1652
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,400
this digital thread engineer in

1653
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,160
many of the organizations that we work

1654
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,079
with is called the model integrator i

1655
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,920
don't know if you have ever heard this

1656
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,640
term before maybe i'm i'm totally wrong

1657
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,559
but but they are called integrators so

1658
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,000
they are the ones who are actually

1659
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,599
responsible for uh you know looking at

1660
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,240
or consuming more like the work of of

1661
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,839
other stakeholders in the process

1662
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,240
systems engineers and other engineers

1663
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,000
and making sure that

1664
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,599
you know there is a there is a

1665
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,440
consistency among the work of those

1666
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,160
people and it is this person

1667
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,640
who is i think the primary target

1668
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,000
audience

1669
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,319
of these more advanced features of the

1670
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,359
the suite but of course as you could see

1671
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,599
we also they were out of the box

1672
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,599
validation logic that is i think very

1673
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,079
useful to systems engineers

1674
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:20,720
and

1675
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,480
what i would like to emphasize again is

1676
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,920
that all the tools that i have been

1677
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,079
showing to you today are web based right

1678
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,839
so they work fast

1679
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,359
long fast

1680
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,160
you can open up the tmt model or or a

1681
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,079
model with millions of elements in your

1682
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,400
browser in a matter of seconds

1683
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,720
instead of you know having to go through

1684
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,440
the

1685
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,240
more traditional way of checking out

1686
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,319
projects and opening them which can take

1687
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,400
a lot longer so the the intention of us

1688
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,319
with this kind of architecture is to

1689
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,440
empower

1690
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,520
the engineers and make these processes a

1691
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
lot faster and a lot more you know

1692
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,400
pleasant and easy to use

1693
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,799
