1
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,560
okay so good evening and welcome to our 
mbse podcast and this time christian and i

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,120
are doing a new episode of our series mbse 
around the world after sweden and then china

3
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,080
this time we visited the united kingdom and 
we want to see how mbse is doing there we

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,840
are happy to have Jon Holt as our guest and 
i think no one can tell us better about it

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,360
so and w ho Jon is uh he will tell you best uh 
himself so please join introduce yourself okay

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,240
thanks very much tim and uh first of all thanks 
to tim and christian for inviting me along it's a

7
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,400
it's a pleasure and an honor to be with you so for 
people who don't know who i am my name is Jon Holt

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,160
and um i've been doing mbsc for my 
whole career now so for almost 30 years

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,160
i work for a company called scarecrow consultants 
limited uh we're based in the uk i'm personally

10
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,520
based in wales in the uk so for those of you in 
europe wales is the slightly wet country to the

11
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,560
left of england for those of you in america it's 
near london somewhere i'm also um a professor of

12
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,560
systems engineering at cranfield university here 
in the uk and if people are aware of in cosi the

13
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,120
international council on systems engineering i'm 
the current technical director of new incosy uk

14
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,640
and i've offered 17 books on model-based 
systems engineering and its application

15
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
in over over the years so that's a 
that's a very brief introduction to me

16
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,800
wonderful yeah thank you Jon so also from 
my side a very warm welcome and yeah as

17
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,880
the technical director uh you for sure can 
tell us in which industries in the uk is

18
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,600
systems engineering or maybe already 
model-based systems engineering used

19
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,560
well it's interesting because i think the same as 
many countries historically systems engineering

20
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,240
and therefore model-based systems engineering 
has been very strong for decades in aerospace

21
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,960
and defense but what we're seeing now is lots of 
other uh different industries coming on board and

22
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,000
i think one of the biggest ones at the moment is 
automotive so you know from about five or seven

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,480
years ago all of a sudden uh automotive has become 
massive and and i think this is important because

24
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,240
i think um what's important about some uh well all 
industries in particular automotive i use those

25
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,400
as the example is because of the the complexity of 
the vehicles of the systems that they're producing

26
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,640
has increased so dramatically over the last few 
years in particular in areas like uh everything

27
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,160
is now connected so every device we buy now is 
now connected everything is potentially part of a

28
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,760
wider system of systems and all of a sudden we've 
seen this sort of this step change in complexity

29
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,760
because of that and because of the different 
technologies involved and because of things

30
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,680
like constraints so safety security standards and 
so on and also shifts in technology so getting

31
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,720
automotive away from internal combustion engines 
over to electric it's been a massive change and a

32
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,200
shift in complexity and i think in order to cope 
with this complexity the i think the techniques

33
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,200
we were using 10 20 30 years ago a document based 
approach and don't get me wrong there's nothing

34
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
wrong with a document-based approach it's not 
incorrect but i think a document-based approach

35
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,800
that worked 10 or 20 years ago is no longer 
adequate for the job because the complexity has

36
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,480
increased so much and i think as the complexity 
of our systems that we're developing increases

37
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,360
therefore the complexity of the approach that 
we're taking to develop those systems must also

38
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
increase and we've seen lots of other areas as 
well so automotive is a very good example but

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,640
also medical devices we see now the last couple 
of years we've been involved in that um energy as

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,920
well so uh right from the whole spectrum from sort 
of nuclear fusion and we're even doing some work

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,320
in steam power at the moment so we're covering 
uh both ends of the spectrum of of energy though

42
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
but yes certainly we've seen more and more 
diverse industries uh adopting model-based

43
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,960
systems engineering and very importantly because 
it's the need that's there it's not because it's

44
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,560
the flavor of the month or it sounds good 
it sounds exciting it's because there's a

45
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
genuine need there to cope with this increased 
complexity that we're seeing in all of our systems

46
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,160
well yeah and for what what purposes mbse use now 
you can use it for for different purposes you can

47
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,840
increase the communication between the team 
and you can use it to specify things or you can

48
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,000
satisfy assessors with tons of generated documents 
now you can do already simulation stuff and

49
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,400
other cool things so is there um a special focus 
in the uk well i mean we work with uh we work with

50
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,320
all different industries and lots of different 
companies academia and government and it's been

51
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,760
used in all sorts of different areas and one 
of the things that i mean one of the things

52
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,400
about model-based systems engineering is if you 
do a google search on the benefits of model-based

53
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
systems engineering what comes up is lots of tool 
vendors say look what my tool does look what my

54
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,840
tool does and they're not really the benefits of 
mbsc they're things that the tool will do and i

55
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,680
think that the benefits of our sort of context 
dependence it really depends on the stakeholders

56
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
you're talking to so we can deal with the same 
organization and if we deal with the engineers we

57
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,840
can say it's great it's going to improve your your 
specification your design your requirements and so

58
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,240
on but if we say that to a manager they're 
not interested so if we talk to a manager

59
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,920
we'll focus on well it will improve your cost 
timing resource estimates and if we're dealing

60
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,800
with somebody at board level we've got to focus on 
things like return on investment and improvement

61
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,000
of the quality attributes of the systems so 
it does vary enormously but i think all of the

62
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,840
all of the topics that you mentioned uh there 
tim are definitely uh you know we've seen it

63
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
used in all of those areas um but it really 
does vary and as i say we work with some

64
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,720
organizations where different teams are getting 
different benefits from using nbc ranging from

65
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,040
you know one company we want to half up 
our development time you know we want to

66
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,440
go from a six year cycle to a three year cycle and 
whereas others are we want to improve our quality

67
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,840
but what is interesting is we find in that 
particular industries are interested in uh or

68
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,120
and this is a very broad generalization but 
tend to be interested in different aspects of it

69
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
so it's interesting you mentioned quality 
when we deal with medical devices company

70
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
their main emphasis seems to be on can we 
comply with the standards and the legislation

71
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,400
because if we can't we can't sell our products 
so for them that's the most important thing

72
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,200
we deal with sort of aerospace type companies 
with typically long life cycles and they're

73
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,600
more more interesting can we shorten our life 
cycles so it really depends on the you know

74
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,600
the stakeholders we're talking to but we do see 
these trends in industries and we see a lot more

75
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,440
collaboration now between organizations you know 
whereas historically uh people were more insular

76
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
we see a lot more collaborations and that's 
where areas like tim you mentioned the improved

77
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,240
communication between the different stakeholders 
and we're seeing that an awful lot as well now so

78
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,120
yeah it's and i think it's because we work in 
lots of different industries that we can see these

79
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,360
different applications being used and i think if 
you were taught if you were to talk to somebody

80
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,320
who worked in a single organization which is most 
people let's face it they would give you a more

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,520
definitive answer this is how we use it this 
is how we use it and one of the big areas that

82
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,080
we do use it for across industry is in defining 
an approach to model-based systems engineering

83
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,920
so actually using the modeling using an mbse 
approach to understand what their business

84
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,440
business needs are to help them change the 
business and you know my personal philosophy is

85
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,880
when it comes to deploying mbse i treat that 
like a system so of course i'm going to apply

86
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,640
mbse to do that and and that's that's a really 
interesting area that's a lot more prevalent now

87
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:09,520
than we saw um you know just just a few years ago 
and uh can you estimate how well mbse is used in

88
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,640
the different industries so is uh defense and 
space still decades ahead or is it changing no

89
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,160
i i really don't think they are anymore and and 
i think that one of the reasons for this is if we

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,960
take industries like automotive uh medical devices 
the life cycles are far shorter and so they need

91
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,240
to get in quicker and get the returns far quicker 
so you know some of the automotive companies we

92
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,160
deal with they're going from a blank piece of 
paper to a car rolling off the production line in

93
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,000
under two years you know you you look at a typical 
aerospace project they haven't even looked at

94
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,960
the requirements in the first two years let alone 
produced anything so we've seen these far shorter

95
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,040
time scales but i also think the the maturity 
as a with the adoption of mbse has increased

96
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,400
dramatically as well so as i said i've been doing 
this for my whole career even though it wasn't

97
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,120
called nbse many many years ago but i remember 
the first thing cozy event i went to i attended

98
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
was the international symposium in 1999 so it 
wasn't even this millennium that's how long ago

99
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,080
it was and it was in brighton and in the uk and 
um and that's when i first got involved in INCOSE

100
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,080
but i used to speak at a lot of conferences so 
we go we're going back 20 22 years now and the

101
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,920
the big argument i would have with people and 
the big point i was trying to convince people

102
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,120
is modeling is a good idea and that and people 
would throw things at me and then argue with

103
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,960
me and it was it got very heated but it was and 
the first book i wrote which was very very slim

104
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,240
it was actually it's pretty sml it was called uml 
for systems engineering it was applying uml to um

105
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,520
and people were getting very cross about that but 
the whole point of the book the emphasis was on

106
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,280
this is why you should model this is my model is 
a good idea and then we found about probably 15

107
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,400
years ago the question changed and it went from 
why should we model to how should we model and

108
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,920
so there was a lot more acceptance about modeling 
so uh so if you look at the books that we write

109
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,480
in 10 years ago we've got one called the monster 
which is like a thousand pages long that weighs

110
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
more than the fat baby essentially it's an 
enormous great uh book and because the question

111
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
had changed or what people wanted to know then is 
how do we model efficiently and effectively and

112
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,440
so there were a lot more interesting things like 
frameworks and processes and these kind of and the

113
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,600
and the art of modeling as well and what we 
found in the last probably three to five years is

114
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,400
the question the emphasis has changed 
again and now the emphasis is very much on

115
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,800
well how do we now deploy this in our organization 
so i think the maturity and the adoption of mbse

116
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,040
has increased enormously over the last couple of 
decades and i think and as the adoption increases

117
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,400
and the maturity increases then the needs of the 
people using it also increase so now it's a lot

118
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,440
more about well how do we deploy it on a project 
that's already running you know there's all that's

119
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,040
that's midway through a project can we still get 
benefit uh how do we um how do you deal with other

120
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,960
people processing tools um no so so i think the 
question has changed but certainly the adoption

121
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,600
is far more widespread and in terms of the the 
number of people is certainly increased but again

122
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,960
i mentioned INCOSE again and i using cozy in the 
uk as a good indicator if you went about 10 or 15

123
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,560
years and you looked at the the the companies 
typically attending our what's now called the

124
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,200
annual systems engineering conference the asec 
and i'm sure you you'd see a similar pattern

125
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,440
across the world it was 80 90 percent aerospace 
and defense and it's no longer the case anymore

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,240
we've seen all sorts of uh different companies 
getting involved now and getting involved with

127
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,960
INCOSE so we have the uk advisory board here 
and that's a group of about 40 companies who are

128
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,480
almost like a steering committee for INCOSE uk and 
you look at the diversity on those companies now

129
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,760
we've got civil engineering companies we've got 
i.t companies as i said automotive medical power

130
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,320
a lot more academia involved now so certainly 
the adoption has become far more widespread and

131
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,440
because of that the questions that are being asked 
have become more a lot more widespread as well

132
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
um and i'll say that that's certainly the picture 
we see in the uk at the moment and certainly just

133
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
in terms of the number of clients that 
we have now in the diversity of them

134
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,840
certainly increased yeah it's interesting that 
in your new book you only need 445 pages to

135
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,640
systems engineering yeah well the reason for 
that you see we we wrote the monster and uh

136
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,960
which was enormous and then people were saying 
yeah we like it but i can't show that to anybody

137
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,520
there's just too much just too much it so then 
we wrote a thing called don't panic which is a

138
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,400
very slim book which is only 50 pages long which 
which there's now a whole series of these books

139
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,440
published by encode uk so that was aimed at 
the the new people and the managers so that

140
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,240
the demystified kind of sits between the two 
so it's more detailed than the um don't panic

141
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,280
but it's not quite as mind-numbing as the 
thousand-page monster and of course if you've

142
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,920
got somebody operates at board level we've got a 
book for them as well which is the children's book

143
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,080
that's aimed at eight-year-olds to 11 year olds 
which is more and if they don't if they don't

144
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,880
understand the engineering they can just color it 
in so that's aimed more at people at a ceo level

145
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,080
but there we go but yeah so the the demystified 
book's an interesting one and i was approached

146
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,240
to write that by an indian publisher and 
again it's interesting because although

147
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,760
it sold across the world obviously the demand 
was coming from uh india and it's interesting

148
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,080
we were talking before about india and 
china and and you know the adoption of

149
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,920
engineering um in in certain countries and 
yeah we've just seen a far wider audience

150
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,200
and also because of who i am if somebody 
asked me to do something as you as you know

151
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,960
know i can't say no i have to just agree to it 
because my ego won't let anybody else do it so

152
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,240
this is why i ended up taking a lot of these 
projects and committing to all sorts of weird

153
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,040
talks and things that that i wouldn't ordinarily 
so when they approached me to do it and they said

154
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,320
it was aimed at this particular market and 
people who are new to the field but wanted

155
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,560
uh some detail and wanted a case study going all 
the way through it so there was quite um not that

156
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,840
strict but they had a very good set of criteria 
that had come from their marketing department and

157
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,320
again that was interesting because the marketing 
was predominantly done as i said in in sort of

158
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,600
india so and it's interesting seeing this these 
these countries really take on board um systems

159
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,080
engineering and in particular model-based systems 
engineering so i think that's a very encouraging

160
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,960
picture for mbse globally i i bought your book 
but i must i bet i haven't read it yet i don't

161
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,839
demystifying systems engineering 
sounds a little bit like you again

162
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,479
try to answer the the why question so 
why should i do assistant editing um

163
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,079
the demystified is really that that's more from 
the publisher it's i think it's a good title

164
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,840
obviously but they they do a series of books 
called demystified um which are aimed at this

165
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,800
particular and it's kind of like so INCOSE uk 
now we have the don't panic books which are you

166
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,960
know set at a higher level but yeah so when they 
approached me they said you know this and they

167
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,200
sent me examples of what some of the other ones 
were but they were all about coding so i couldn't

168
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,840
really read them but they were so that um so yeah 
so the title of that and um that was one of the

169
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,080
things that they uh kind of came up with but apart 
from that they gave me quite a lot of freedom in

170
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,320
the book to to write what i wanted so it was a 
very good process working with them yeah writing

171
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,280
work i took a short look into it and uh it was 
interesting for me that you are referring at the

172
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,200
end or the beginning of every chapter to how 
does it comply to iso 15 to 88 well i think

173
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,280
to me the the the provenance of engineering 
is very important and i think demonstration

174
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,640
compliance is very important i think increasingly 
for a number of industries now and you know i'm

175
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,880
the first to admit things like iso standards 
aren't perfect but it gives us a good it gives us

176
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,440
a good target to aim for and one of the problems 
you'll get is with model-based systems engineering

177
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
people want to say well how does it relate to the 
way that we do things already or you know how can

178
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,800
it solve these problems for us so that was a very 
deliberate part of the book is wherever possible

179
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,840
are related and it's something that 
we reflect in our working philosophy

180
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,120
philosophy anyway we try and relate it to 
what's what's acknowledged as sort of best

181
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,720
practice and in the world today so the two big 
standards we use in the book are obviously 15

182
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,800
to 88 which is more of the process side of 
things but also the 42010 and the associated

183
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
standards which are more about architecture and 
architecture framework um but we use those as

184
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,720
a central part obviously of all the modelling 
that we do because when we do modeling a large

185
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,240
part of the book is advocating creating a good 
framework for the model and so again we want to

186
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,880
reference that to best international practice 
and i think the two standards work well together

187
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,920
as i said then the standards aren't perfect by 
any means but they're a really good best practice

188
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,600
model they're acknowledged across the world and 
it just gives you that extra level of credibility

189
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
um because i know from experience people will 
say yeah but we do things like this already

190
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,560
how does mbse help us so it's kind of he's trying 
to preempt that question if you like and say well

191
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,800
here's your best practice model you can use it 
to do this you can use it to do this but what's

192
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,880
what what that also allows you to do which is very 
interesting is you know i don't need to tell you

193
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,240
two about things like reuse but for lots of 
people who don't have a modeling background

194
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
this is quite big news to them and when you 
can say well actually for this part of the iso

195
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,160
standard remember that thing we did a while back 
and we produced these views in this model we can

196
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,680
reuse those for this part as well so things that 
we did in requirements and we'd be doing scenario

197
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,240
modelling and things like that we can reuse those 
now as part of our acceptance testing that we're

198
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,760
now using as part of our vnv and so it allows 
you to to do things like that and to make these

199
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,120
references back and and i think that's that's very 
important as well because i don't want to get too

200
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,160
much into reuse but reuse is one of those things 
that i remember back in the sort of mid-80s and

201
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,120
early 90s everything was about reuse and object 
orientation and there were a lot of myths and a

202
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,680
lot of expectations that weren't quite met but 
from a modeling point of view i think reuses is

203
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,640
very very possible when it's done properly and 
so i think that was an important point that we

204
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,320
wanted to make as well and again the use of 
standards is a good gives us a good mechanism

205
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,640
to show that particularly when it came to so 
there's one chapter on management for example

206
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,720
and almost all the views that we create in 
management are based on the engineering views

207
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,680
and and that that was a that's a nice exercise to 
do and that's a point that we're often trying to

208
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,040
make to people as well is why do we have these two 
completely separate disciplines that won't talk to

209
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,080
one another when actually we're all looking at the 
same thing and i think this is a classic problem

210
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,080
that we have in systems engineering to me one of 
the biggest problems that we have with systems

211
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,200
engineering is the word engineering because it 
scares people away because people will say well

212
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
i'm not an engineer i can't possibly understand 
what you're talking about we do things differently

213
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,800
whereas if you say systems thinking or a systems 
approach oh everybody wants a systems approach

214
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,520
everybody wants new systems thinking but yeah you 
say systems engineering and people people run for

215
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:03,600
the hills screaming so which can be a problem yeah 
i also have more and more customers asking for iso

216
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,640
i think iso provides some stable more stable 
areas in this very dynamic environment so it

217
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,080
feels a little bit more safe so many people ask 
me how to map this mod to iso and the system

218
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,800
ellen iso standard and this is standard and so 
on and it is and people like the the comfort

219
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,200
of iso as well we used to have an expression 
in the uk i'm sure it was worldwide that said

220
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,800
nobody ever got fired for buying ibm right i won't 
comment on how valid that is as a statement now

221
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,120
but it's that same philosophy which is well if 
you're referencing iso you're not going to get

222
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,480
into trouble for you know complying with an 
iso standard oh that was my cat just leaking

223
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,880
up then making it he he's not a big fan of iso 
as soon as i mentioned that he leaves the room

224
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,840
um yeah i think i thought oh sorry it was also 
very interesting what you said about the maturity

225
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:05,920
of mbse um and i think well in the past tools and 
methods could do much more than the people needed

226
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,720
but i think now we are in a change and today 
people need more than the tools and methodologies

227
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,840
can provide so i i couldn't agree to more with you 
tim absolutely and and i think for so many years

228
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,680
uh this i will say now this is my personal opinion 
and not aimed at any particular tool vendor um but

229
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,800
for so many years we had tools that were doing 
so so much stuff that nobody would ever use and

230
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,360
it was never required i mean who's 
ever wanted shadows on their lines

231
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,960
and this sort of insanity and all these different 
techniques and all these that um people marketing

232
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,400
people tried to convince us we needed and we 
you know just give us the basic functionality um

233
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,520
but i think for many years with all the tools 
were way ahead of the game and would be providing

234
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,920
functionality that you know people weren't using 
but i think suddenly now the last five years so i

235
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,200
i agree i think now the tools are playing 
catch up and i think in some cases they're

236
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,880
focused on the wrong areas um but i think also 
like i said we're living in a connected world

237
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,760
i think this idea of a single vendor people who 
finally realizing is not particularly realistic

238
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,320
particularly when you work in a big organization 
when you work in a large company you're going to

239
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,360
be using multiple tools from different vendors 
and i think one of the biggest issues at the

240
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,840
moment is tool interoperability so actually 
you're using a requirements tool for one vendor

241
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,880
you're using a system or modeling tool from 
another vendor we've then got a plm environment

242
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,680
that somehow sticks holders together we've got 
the mathematics and the simulation side of things

243
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,560
and we need all these things to work together and 
i think at the moment most of the tools that i see

244
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:57,840
on the market are shockingly bad in this area of 
tool interoperability and i think particularly in

245
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,080
areas like the visual world of snl compared to the 
the formal mathematical world of simulation and

246
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,120
you know we've got mechanisms in csml that give 
us that bridge you know so things like parametrics

247
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,320
give us a natural bridge into those but i think 
many of the tools at the moment are terrible

248
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,440
to be quite frank in that area and i think this 
is an area that needs to have a lot of improvement

249
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,720
and i also think that you look at some tools 
and the usability of them um if you if you

250
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,440
went back 10 or 15 years it was it was the same 
with many industries but software in particular

251
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,680
um software was telling you what you wanted 
the vendors were saying no no you should do

252
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,920
that you want to do it like this you want to do 
it like this people aren't that willing to accept

253
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,760
that anymore and i think using something we did 
speak about briefly earlier to him but you know

254
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
using a tool with an interface that's 20 
or 30 years old and hasn't really moved on

255
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:01,040
is is no longer good enough and and i don't think 
some of the vendors realize that usability is such

256
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,920
a big issue at the moment because it really is and 
again i would rather the vendors focused on making

257
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:14,000
the core functionality very usable user-friendly 
and compatible with other tools and so on

258
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,280
than having the equivalent of windings on a 
uh on a modeling tool which is essentially

259
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,120
what they they're doing in many cases um but 
but yeah and you think any other software if

260
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,760
it had an interface that old you wouldn't 
uh you know you wouldn't go near it but um

261
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,880
but but but i really think that's a big issue 
to my mind that i think they're the two biggest

262
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,280
issues i have with them the first one at 
the moment is the the whole interoperability

263
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,640
of the tools um and also the usability of 
them and these things aren't cheap either

264
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,640
you know as we've just discussed before um and 
they seem to be getting more more expensive as

265
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,760
time goes on and i think the the responsibilities 
on the vendors now to actually produce something

266
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,600
that's more fit for purpose and many of the tools 
are that's as diplomatic as i can be about tools

267
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,000
yeah we have two comments in the live chat this 
time so um okay one recommendation for your book

268
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,680
that it's a great book by the way and we have a 
comment from thanks mum she always joins in on

269
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,560
these podcasts we have a comment from mark 
who suggests that we just have to rewrite

270
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,440
the standards as models well this is a really 
important point and it's something that i've been

271
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,160
i've spoken to iso too i've been involved with 
iso for a number of years for years and years and

272
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,640
years on and one of the ways that we demonstrate 
compliance is we model the standards and again

273
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
anybody with any modeling knowledge will know that 
just the very act of modeling gives you a very

274
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,480
good indication on how well-written something 
is and if something's very well written and

275
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,920
well specified in your model it the model just 
falls out and it's it's easy if it's difficult

276
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,680
to do the modeling if there's a lot of ambient it 
tells you about how badly written the the source

277
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,880
information is and we've been doing this for 
years and years we've uh in fact one of the first

278
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,960
um what we now refer to as the sort of frameworks 
we use and so on uh one of the first ones that

279
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,280
that we produce back in if in fact i'll tell 
you how long it was i mentioned the first

280
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:26,720
INCOSE conference i went to is in 1999 the paper 
i presented was on using uml to model standards

281
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,120
right so and because standards were so com look 
at standards look at best practice models there's

282
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,040
hundreds of them they're very complex they all 
use different language they're difficult to

283
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,160
communicate with people people don't understand 
them it's the perfect candidate for modeling

284
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,400
you know it takes all the modeling boxes 
why you need to model and we why people

285
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,760
don't define standard using models is beyond me 
and i've spoken to not just i said to different

286
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
standards bodies before as well to say you know 
you should be doing them like this because it

287
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
it makes them far less ambiguous it makes 
them easy to communicate you can translate

288
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,560
into different languages far easier and uh yeah i 
think that's a so mark i love you mark that was an

289
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,360
excellent point and i i couldn't agree with you 
more but also when it comes to compliance if we

290
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,800
model our own processes and frameworks using the 
same technology modeling techniques that we then

291
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,440
model our standards within our best practice 
models the compliance we can build into the

292
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,600
models in and we can actually import them into the 
tools and the compliance is then built into our to

293
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,240
our overall model so and to me it's so obvious yet 
so few people do it you know and i think that's a

294
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:44,080
a really really good observation there from by the 
way we started um creating a document generation

295
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,600
from the model for the sysworld1 specification and 
we found many inconsistencies in the specification

296
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,800
and the previous as well one versions 
and also the uml versions are

297
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:05,520
well partly they are modeled but most of the stuff 
is pure text document and yeah and you see this in

298
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,040
in so many standards and particularly if you do 
any working frameworks and um you know things

299
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,480
like the the the defense-based architectural 
framework so that the the modafs the dodas the

300
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,480
zindas the nafs and so on if you you just do 
the most basic of modelling on those and they

301
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,440
they expose themselves for the bag of spanners 
that they really are so yes but model absolutely

302
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,240
model standards model best practice references 
whether it's in-house procedures whether it's

303
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,960
framework definitions and it will give you 
all sorts of insights into what you're doing

304
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
and it gives you just a really good 
indication of how good the source material is

305
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,520
yeah we have a very interesting discussion in 
the chat about interoperability and i guess we

306
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,240
have to have it as an own topic on another 
day but definitely definitely absolutely

307
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,800
but for now i would like to change the topic 
a little bit on your professorship so you're

308
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:12,400
teaching systems engineering you're teaching at 
a at a university is it the only worst university

309
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,480
where you can have systems engineering lessons 
or is it wider spread and what do i do when

310
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:29,120
i mean it's clear it's clear it's the best taught 
systems engineering in the uk if not the world but

311
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,800
apart from that we've seen an increase in the 
number of universities that are offering systems

312
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,880
engineering and more important that we've seen a 
big increase in the quality and i think it's fair

313
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,640
to say if you went back 10 years and you looked 
at universities not all but some universities

314
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
they they would look at systems engineering 
well we'll just take a bit of mechanical a

315
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,960
bit of electrical a bit of civil a bit of software 
or a bit of management we'll mix it all together

316
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,840
and out comes the systems engineering degree for 
example and so what we're seeing now is actually

317
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,360
and to me that that's kind of a master of nom 
kind of approach you know but what we're really

318
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,920
seeing now the last sort of five or ten years is 
universities creating these courses from scratch

319
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,040
and then bringing in other modules obviously 
reusing from other as and when but actually um

320
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,600
they're really holding very well together as um 
as systems engineering courses when it comes to

321
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,800
modeling and a problem that i've often had with 
with uh which is good news for me because one of

322
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,200
the things i do in scarecrows i teach modelling 
is people are leaving university and they've been

323
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,680
taught something like uml or sisuml but they've 
been taught by somebody who's never used it in

324
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,320
anger they've been taught somebody who's read the 
spec and understands it and understands modeling

325
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,400
but but you know as you'll as you'll both 
know there's a big difference between

326
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,560
understanding what the diamond means and should it 
be colored in an opera and actually applying this

327
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,120
onto a real project and and i think that that's 
very interesting and that's what we've seen a

328
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,960
lot of now and i think also to be fair it's it's 
why i was offered my position in the first place

329
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,600
or one of the reasons it was offered uh apart 
from the good looks was because i had lots of

330
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,720
industrial experience and they wanted to bring 
that they wanted to bring that into the course

331
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,120
and and i think that's very important as well 
so we've seen a lot more uh systems engineering

332
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,800
being adopted and we're also seeing a lot more 
now that the default is modelling is involved in

333
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,720
it somehow even if it's not you know full what i 
call sort of stage five mbse this modeling is is

334
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,960
an increasingly important part of what we're doing 
um when it comes to systems engineering so i think

335
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,160
the the education system is uh is improving we do 
in and we have some working groups within encode

336
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,600
uk to look at this and in fact i do work with i've 
mentioned very briefly the children's book that we

337
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,960
wrote but i do we have what we call stem in the 
uk so stemi science technology engineering and

338
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,200
mathematics and so it's really promoting things 
like engine for me obviously it's all stem but

339
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,280
secretly the e part of the stem to school children 
so i'm also involved in doing um well i'll say i'm

340
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,159
involved i haven't been for the last 15 months for 
obvious reasons but i used to do a lot of sort of

341
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,959
evening lectures and science festivals music 
festivals i've got a music festival coming up

342
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:25,360
at the end of july so what i also do which uh you 
probably most people don't know is sources well

343
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,719
i do uh i'm also a magician um as well as being 
an assistant engineer so i do uh science and

344
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:39,839
music festivals where i use magic to communicate 
uh systems engineering to people so we can talk

345
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,840
about things all the things we talk about in 
modelling good communication looking at things

346
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,360
from different points of view visualization all 
these kinds of things so visualization the things

347
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,000
that we would think about in sml we can use as a 
basis for doing memory acts and things like that

348
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,520
so i can memorize a deck of cards using the same 
visualization techniques i use i used to model

349
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,320
you know a car or an airplane or a medical system 
so so there's a lot more work being done trying

350
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,800
to get into younger uh to convey um engineering in 
particular systems engineers obviously my emphasis

351
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,600
to the younger generation as well and because 
obviously you want to get them before they go

352
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,000
to universities to try and get them excited and 
kind of inspired in some way and and i think

353
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,880
that's very important and we're starting to see 
some of that come through now and uh and it's also

354
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,040
as a sign of getting old as well when when i meet 
some when i meet an enormous man for example or or

355
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,280
a full grown woman and they say to me oh i saw you 
when i was a child at a school it makes me feel

356
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,360
happy inside but old on the outside when that 
sort of thing happens so i think it's important

357
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,920
that we we can yes get it into universities 
and yes improve the way we're doing that

358
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
but i also think it's important that we can we can

359
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,480
go before that and get children uh you know 
a younger age because everybody's naturally

360
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,760
curious about things and you know you mentioned 
engineering people um people switch off you

361
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,200
mention problem solving everybody gets excited 
you know what's engineering if not problem solving

362
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,120
and we do it by you know at the simplest level 
drawing pictures of stuff and that's naturally how

363
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,600
people work that's naturally how people think and 
for some reason that gets driven out of people's

364
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,880
minds to naturally think in images and visualize 
things as we go through the education system

365
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,920
um would you say that there's something

366
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,280
special about mbse in the uk compared 
to other countries except Jon Holt

367
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:56,000
this is what i get special um i don't know if 
it's particularly special in the uk um i think

368
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,640
many countries it's a big 
stereotype but many companies

369
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,600
have a particular mentality as well in the 
way that i go about in the way they go about

370
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:12,160
things and what i've seen in the uk is these 
mentalities can be associated with industries

371
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,440
so again i'm engineering space if they were 
early adopters of systems engineering and

372
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,600
model-based systems engineering but they again 
broad generalization far less open to new ideas

373
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,320
than you get automotive medical devices that you 
know they're coming to the party late but they're

374
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,720
having a very good time when they get there you 
know and they're a lot more receptive to try and

375
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,400
change the way that they work and so on um and i 
think that's the big thing to me the big blocker

376
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,600
with mbse it's the people you know we often talk 
about people processing tools it's the people side

377
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,880
of things and it's winning that battle with people 
it's getting them to be able to see for themselves

378
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
rather than just tell them do it this the way you 
do it this way it's great getting them to see for

379
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,920
themselves and realize that actually this is a 
good way to do things and there are benefits in it

380
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
for different people so it's that 
attitude change and i found that that's

381
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,800
more to do with the industries than sort of 
geographically where we go um and it can also be

382
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,240
you know a younger generation coming through tend 
to be more open to new ideas than and i include

383
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,600
myself in this old white middle-aged straight men 
essentially which is what the industry is full of

384
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,600
at the moment but as we see more diversity from 
you know in all different areas coming through um

385
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,680
coming through engineering because i still 
think we're behind on this but i think a

386
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,320
natural emergent property of diversity is people 
having a more open mind and people being more

387
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:45,840
receptive to you know maybe slightly different or 
newer ideas than people of older generations um

388
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,000
and i think that's very important so 
i think the future's very bright and

389
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,600
i think that's what we've got to focus on 
is look at the future and say yeah can we

390
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:59,520
inspire the next generation of engineers and wow 
what can what is it possible they can achieve

391
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,080
that just with a more open mindset and with you 
you know open up the rise to these different

392
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,640
techniques so things that have been taking me 30 
years to show to people who finally get them to

393
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,800
commence you know what about people who don't 
have to do that who can just try out these new

394
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,320
ideas new areas and that the potential has got to 
be enormous across the you know across the world

395
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:28,400
yeah one one very funny thing is if you 
follow scarecrow consultants on linkedin

396
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,400
is that you publish every week 
a riddle a scissor millenary on

397
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:47,040
song titles expressed in a sml diagram so so 
we've um i i like puzzles i like terrible jokes

398
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,240
uh i like music i like film so there's a game 
there's a very popular sort of parlor game

399
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,880
this called pictionary which is like 
picture dictionary so you draw pictures

400
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
that represent films and so on and so he 
started off as a bit of a joke where it was well

401
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,160
when i do courses and comments and things and 
i and i would say oh you can represent any any

402
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,640
information using modeling because it's just a 
way to visualize things and so people would say

403
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,520
oh can you do this can you do this so it started 
off as a bit of a joke doing things like that but

404
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,720
no we do it every friday night so it's usually 
a film or a uh or a song um so if it's a film it

405
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,600
might be the film title or it might be so this 
week we we've actually got a scene from a film

406
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:36,800
that we've we've done with a sequence diagram and 
so we use sysaml to uh to visualize either the

407
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,800
title or some of the lyrics of a song or whatever 
um occasionally we'll do it for people uh very

408
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,960
occasionally we'll do it for a type of cheese 
so it really depends on what we do but we've

409
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,960
got quite a big following on this now and it's 
it's interesting wherever i i say wherever i go

410
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,400
wherever i used to go and will hopefully be going 
again soon people come and approach me and uh you

411
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,040
know i was in america for example a few years ago 
and rick stein came up to me and he says every

412
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,200
friday we gather the whole research group round 
and uh we all see who can get it first there's a

413
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,080
bit of a competition going on and it's really 
fascinating you just go what really that that

414
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,520
that terrible puzzle that we do every week um but 
it but it's great and it gets people interested

415
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,960
and very occasionally people say they learn a bit 
of sml from it as well but i think it's getting

416
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,560
people thinking in an abstract way it's not just 
about designing the new aeroplane the new car the

417
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,880
train or whatever you can use these techniques to 
convey any kind of information and in fact it was

418
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,640
rick stein that said to me which really stuck in 
my mind he said well you can only truly master any

419
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,640
language if you can express humor in it and he and 
he said and that's what system element does so he

420
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,160
uses that as an example for some of his students 
and i think that's very important so if you do go

421
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,720
onto our linkedin page and you do this you have 
to go with an open mind and bear in mind there

422
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,640
are some terrible terrible misinterpretations 
of song titles and things like that on it so uh

423
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,640
but yeah so we do that every friday it's a good 
fun thing to come along and uh and join in if you

424
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,520
do and if you're very lucky you might even have 
it dedicated to you one week that's that's the uh

425
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,760
that's the goal tim yeah last week 
it reminds me of a great film well

426
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:30,320
very good um is it correct that is that you 
published some of them in a book i think

427
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,000
when we go to conferences and things 
so we'll collect like a year together

428
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,400
and just print them in a book and we can uh well 
we normally give them out uh just as like a free

429
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,920
thing and people tend to like it and then we give 
match prizes and things like that as well but then

430
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:53,120
we we print them through an online uh publishing 
uh company and um so just just for a joke simon

431
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,880
one of my colleagues where i write a lot of the 
books with he said oh we'll just put it up for

432
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,440
five pounds and see if anybody's stupid enough 
to buy it somebody in canada bought 50 copies

433
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,440
okay it's full with money as they say ain't 
hardly a fall at all but but no so we we do the

434
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,680
so people want the hard copy just send me an email 
we will send you some out so we give those away at

435
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,040
conferences and things like that we don't normally 
charge for those but it's normally just like the

436
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,960
last year that we've done and put together and 
it's kind of nice uh just to have them in you and

437
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,440
