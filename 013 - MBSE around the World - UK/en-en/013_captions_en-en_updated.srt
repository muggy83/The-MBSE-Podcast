00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,153
Okay, so good evening

2
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:44,110
And welcome to our MBSE Podcast

3
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,310
And this time

4
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,880
Christian and I are doing a new episode of
our series MBSE around the world

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,840
after Sweden and then China

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,586
This time, we visited the United Kingdom

7
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:02,080
And we want to see
how MBSE is doing there

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,700
We are happy to have
Jon Holt as our guest

9
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,560
And I think no one can
tell us better about it

10
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,270
and who Jon is

11
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,705
He will tell you best himself

12
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,270
Please Jon, introduce yourself

13
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,210
Okay, thanks very much Tim

14
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,800
First of all, thanks to Tim and
Christian for inviting me along

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,580
It's a pleasure
and an honor to be with you

16
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,662
For people who don't know 
who I am, my name is Jon Holt

17
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:32,160
And I've been doing MBSE for my 
whole career now, for almost 30 years

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,970
I work for a company called 
Scarecrow Consultants Limited

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,225
We're based in the UK

20
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm personally based in Wales in the UK

21
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,370
For those of you in Europe

22
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,840
Wales is the slightly wet country
to the left of England

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,500
For those of you in America

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,135
it's near London somewhere

25
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,433
I'm also a professor of
systems engineering

26
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,062
at Cranfield University here in the UK

27
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:56,560
And if people are aware of INCOSE

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,870
the International Council
of Systems Engineering

29
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm the current technical director
of new INCOSE UK

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,335
And I've offered 17 books on
model-based systems engineering

31
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:10,340
and its application
in over the years

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,070
That's a very brief
introduction to me

33
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:16,362
Wonderful!

34
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,190
Thank you, Jon

35
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,500
Also from my side
a very warm welcome

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,820
And as the technical director

37
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,354
you can tell us in which industries
in the UK is systems engineering

38
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:35,600
or maybe already model-based
systems engineering used

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,898
It's interesting

40
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:42,560
because I think the same as many countries
historically systems engineering

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,910
and therefore model-based
systems engineering

42
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,060
has been very strong for decades
in aerospace and defense

43
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,560
But what we're seeing now is lots of
other different industries coming on board

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,780
And I think one of the biggest ones
at the moment is automotive

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,588
From about 5 or 7 years ago

46
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:06,160
all of a sudden
automotive has become massive

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,234
And I think this is important

48
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:14,807
because I think what's important
about all industries

49
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,381
in particular automotive
I use those as the example

50
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,200
is because of the the complexity
of the vehicles of the systems

51
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,400
that they're producing

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,091
has increased so dramatically
over the last few years

53
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:29,500
In particular, in areas like
everything is now connected

54
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,221
every device we buy now is now connected

55
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,767
everything is potentially part of
a wider system of systems

56
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:39,760
And all of a sudden, we've seen this sort
of this step change in complexity

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,140
because of that and because of
the different technologies involved

58
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,510
and because of things like constraints
safety/security standards and so on

59
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,850
And also, shifts in technology
so getting automotive

60
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,390
away from internal combustion
engines over to electric

61
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,347
it's been a massive change
and a shift in complexity

62
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,730
And I think in order to
cope with this complexity

63
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,446
the techniques we were using
10, 20, 30 years ago

64
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:07,796
a document based approach

65
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:08,706
don't get me wrong

66
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,192
there's nothing wrong with
a document-based approach

67
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:12,076
it's not incorrect

68
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:15,710
but I think a document-based approach
that worked 10 or 20 years ago

69
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,930
is no longer adequate for the job because
the complexity has increased so much

70
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,610
And I think as the complexity of our
systems that we're developing increases

71
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,690
therefore the complexity of the approach

72
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,102
that we're taking to develop those
systems must also increase

73
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:34,050
And we've seen lots of other areas as well
automotive is a very good example

74
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,000
But also medical devices we see
now the last couple of years

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,820
we've been involved in that

76
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,203
Energy as well

77
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:45,301
From the whole spectrum
from sort of nuclear fusion

78
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:48,530
And we're even doing some work
in steam power at the moment

79
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,320
We're covering both ends
of the spectrum of of energy though

80
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,430
Certainly we've seen
more and more diverse industries

81
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,620
adopting model-based systems engineering

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,960
And very importantly
because it's the need that's there

83
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,174
It's not because it's 
the flavor of the month

84
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,022
or it sounds good
it sounds exciting

85
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,011
It's because there's
a genuine need there

86
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:12,792
to cope with this increased complexity
that we're seeing in all of our systems

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,060
And what purposes MBSE use now?

88
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,160
You can use it for different purposes

89
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,610
You can increase the communication
between the team

90
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,755
And you can use it to specify things

91
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:29,580
Or you can satisfy assessors with
tons of generated documents

92
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,711
Now you can do already simulation
stuff and other cool things

93
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:38,020
Is there a special focus in the UK?

94
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,589
We work with all different industries

95
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:45,344
and lots of different companies
academia and government

96
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:48,388
And it's been used in
all sorts of different areas

97
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:54,046
And one of the things about
model-based systems engineering is

98
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,695
if you do a google search on the benefits
of model-based systems engineering

99
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:59,660
what comes up is lots of tool vendors say

100
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,252
"Look what my tool does!"
"Look what my tool does!"

101
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,140
They're not really the benefits of MBSE

102
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,940
They're things that the tool will do

103
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,990
And I think that the benefits of
our sort of context dependence

104
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,409
it really depends on
the stakeholders you're talking to

105
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,379
We can deal with the same organization

106
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:18,010
And if we deal with the engineers
We can say it's great

107
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,440
it's going to improve your specification
your design, your requirements, and so on

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,995
But if we say that to a manager
they're not interested

109
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,481
If we talk to a manager
we'll focus on

110
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,747
it will improve your cost
timing, resource estimates

111
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:33,380
And if we're dealing with
somebody at board level

112
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,394
we've got to focus on things
like return on investment

113
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:39,090
and improvement of the quality
attributes of the systems

114
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,812
It does vary enormously

115
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:45,899
But I think all of the topics that 
you mentioned there are definitely

116
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,140
we've seen it used in all of those areas

117
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,900
But it really does vary

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,420
And as I say, we work with some
organizations where different teams

119
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,720
are getting different benefits
from using MBSE arranging from

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,580
one company we want to
half up our development time

121
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,940
we want to go from a six year
cycle to a three year cycle

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,440
and whereas others are
we want to improve our quality

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,638
But what is interesting is we find in that
particular industries are interested in

124
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,640
and this is a very broad generalization

125
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,120
but tend to be interested in
different aspects of it

126
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
It's interesting, you mentioned, quality 
when we deal with medical devices company

127
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,664
their main emphasis seems to be on

128
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,390
"Can we comply with the standards
and the legislation?"

129
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,820
Because if we can't
we can't sell our products

130
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,960
So for them
that's the most important thing

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,940
We deal with sort of aerospace type
companies with typically long life cycles

132
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,510
And they're more and more interesting
"Can we shorten our life cycles?"

133
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,300
It really depends on
the stakeholders we're talking to

134
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,177
But we do see these trends in industries

135
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:56,100
And we see a lot more collaboration
now between organizations

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,440
whereas historically people
were more insular

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,540
we see a lot more collaborations

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,270
And that's where areas like

139
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,270
Tim, you mentioned

140
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,205
the improved communication
between the different stakeholders

141
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:10,240
And we're seeing that
an awful lot as well now

142
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,053
I think it's because we work in
lots of different industries

143
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,065
that we can see these
different applications being used

144
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:20,020
And I think if you were taught
if you were to talk to somebody

145
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,320
who worked in a single organization
which is most people let's face it

146
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,438
they would give you
a more definitive answer

147
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,740
"This is how we use it"
"This is how we use it"

148
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,511
And one of the big areas that
we do use it for across industry is

149
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,080
in defining an approach to
model-based systems engineering

150
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,757
Actually using the modeling
using a MBSE approach

151
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,625
to understand what their business

152
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,230
business needs are to help
them change the business

153
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,160
And my personal philosophy is

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,280
when it comes to deploying MBSE
I treat that like a system

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,295
I'm going to apply MBSE to do that

156
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,845
And that's a really interesting area

157
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,640
That's a lot more prevalent now

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,150
than we saw just a few years ago

159
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:11,051
Can you estimate how well MBSE
is used in the different industries?

160
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:16,048
Is defense and space still
decades ahead, or is it changing?

161
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,116
No, I really don't think they are anymore

162
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:22,040
And I think that one of
the reasons for this is

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,121
if we take industries like
automotive, medical devices

164
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,515
the life cycles are far shorter

165
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,140
And they need to get in quicker
and get the returns far quicker

166
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,897
Some of the automotive
companies we deal with

167
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:37,092
they're going from a blank piece of paper

168
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:41,094
to a car rolling off the production
line in under 2 years

169
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:44,780
You look at a typical aerospace project

170
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,040
they haven't even looked at the
requirements in the first 2 years

171
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,621
let alone produced anything

172
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,090
We've seen these far shorter time scales

173
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:58,338
But I also think the the maturity
with the adoption of MBSE

174
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:00,544
has increased dramatically as well

175
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:03,520
As I said, I've been doing
this for my whole career

176
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,520
even though it wasn't called
MBSE many years ago

177
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,120
But I remember the first INCOSE
event I went to and I attended

178
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
was the international symposium in 1999

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,110
It wasn't even this millennium
that's how long ago it was

180
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,087
It was in Brighton in the UK

181
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:22,480
That's when I first got involved in INCOSE

182
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,070
But I used to speak
at a lot of conferences

183
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,580
We're going back 22 years now

184
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,795
The big argument I would have with people

185
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:32,233
and the big point I was
trying to convince people

186
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,770
is modeling is a good idea

187
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,120
And people would throw things at me

188
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,420
and then argue with me
and it got very heated

189
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,960
And the first book I wrote
which was very slim

190
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,020
It was actually pretty SysML

191
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,045
It was called
"UML for Systems Engineering"

192
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,240
It was applying UML too

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,195
And people were getting
very across about that

194
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,760
But the whole point of the book
the emphasis was on

195
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,910
This is why you should model

196
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,730
This is why my model is a good idea

197
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,063
And then we found about
probably 15 years ago

198
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,580
the question changed

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,152
And it went from "Why should we model?"
to "How should we model?"

200
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:11,380
There was a lot more
acceptance about modeling

201
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,781
If you look at the books
that we write in 10 years ago

202
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,417
we've got one called the "Monster"

203
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,840
which is like a thousand
pages long that weighs

204
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,123
more than the fat baby

205
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:22,190
Essentially it's an enormous great book

206
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,390
And because the question had changed

207
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,119
what people wanted to know then is

208
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,320
"How do we model
efficiently and effectively?"

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,300
There were a lot more interesting things

210
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,715
like frameworks and processes
and these kinds

211
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:35,159
and the art of modeling as well

212
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,600
And what we found in the last
probably three to 5 years is

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,260
the question, the emphasis
has changed again

214
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,400
And now the emphasis is very much on

215
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,723
"How do we now deploy
this in our organization?"

216
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:52,282
I think the maturity and the adoption
of MBSE have increased enormously

217
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:54,343
over the last couple of decades

218
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:58,245
And I think as the adoption increases
and the maturity increases

219
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,554
then the needs of the people
using it also increase

220
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:02,860
So now
it's a lot more about

221
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,942
"How do we deploy it on a project
that's already running?"

222
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,152
That's all

223
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,140
That's midway through a project

224
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,850
"Can we still get benefit?"

225
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,483
"How do you deal with other
people processing tools?"

226
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,526
I think the question has changed

227
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:20,700
But certainly the adoption is
far more widespread

228
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,204
And the number of people
is certainly increased

229
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,827
But again, I mentioned INCOSE again

230
00:13:27,827 --> 00:13:31,294
I used INCOSE in the UK
as a good indicator

231
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,539
If you went back 10 or 15 years

232
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,785
and you looked at the companies
typically attending

233
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:41,000
what's now called the annual systems
engineering conference, the ASEC

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,166
And I'm sure you'd see a similar
pattern across the world

235
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,553
it was 80 to 90 percent
aerospace and defense

236
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,770
And it's no longer the case anymore

237
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,240
We've seen all sorts of different
companies getting involved now

238
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,800
and getting involved with INCOSE

239
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,154
We have the UK advisory board here

240
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,760
And that's a group of about 40 companies

241
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,621
who are almost like a steering
committee for INCOSE UK

242
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:06,480
And you look at the diversity
on those companies now

243
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,465
We've got civil engineering companies

244
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:09,774
we've got IT companies

245
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:13,261
As I said, automotive, medical power

246
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:15,928
a lot more academia involved now

247
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:19,960
Certainly the adoption has
become far more widespread

248
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,151
And because of that

249
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:26,240
the questions that are being asked have
become more a lot more widespread as well

250
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,650
And I'll say that that's certainly the
picture we see in the UK at the moment

251
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,959
And certainly just in terms of the
number of clients that we have now

252
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,651
in the diversity of them
it's certainly increased

253
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,814
It's interesting that in your new book

254
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:46,035
you only need 445 pages to
demystify systems engineering

255
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,500
The reason for that, we wrote the
"Monster" and which was enormous

256
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,960
And then people were saying we like it
but I can't show that to anybody

257
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,250
This it too much
just too much it

258
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,650
So then, we wrote a thing
called "DON'T PANIC"

259
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,240
which is a very slim book
which is only 50 pages long

260
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,922
which there's now a whole series of
these books published by INCOSE UK

261
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:08,984
That was aimed at the new
people and the managers

262
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,760
The "Demystified" comes
to sit between the two

263
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,240
It's more detailed than "DON'T PANIC"

264
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,280
But it's not quite as mind-numbing
as the thousand-page "Monster"

265
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,448
And of course, if you've got
somebody operates at board level

266
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:26,406
we've got a book for them as well
which is the children's book

267
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:29,470
that's aimed at eight-year-olds to
eleven-year-old which is more

268
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,545
If they don't understand
the engineering

269
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,170
they can just color it

270
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,592
That's aimed more at
people at a CEO level

271
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:37,592
But there we go

272
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,675
The "Demystified" book
is an interesting one

273
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:44,199
And I was approached to write
that by an Indian publisher

274
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,260
It's interesting because although
it sold across the world obviously

275
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,642
the demand was coming from India

276
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,760
And it's interesting

277
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,748
we were talking before
about India and China

278
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:58,860
and the adoption of engineering
in certain countries

279
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,720
And we've just seen a far wider audience

280
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,265
And also because of who I am

281
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,318
if somebody asked me to do something

282
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,980
I can't say "No"
I have to just agree to it

283
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,340
Because my ego won't
let anybody else do it

284
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,179
this is why I ended up taking
a lot of these projects

285
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:21,151
and committing to all sorts of weird talks
and things that I wouldn't ordinarily

286
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,712
When they approached me to do it

287
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:25,070
they said it was aimed at
this particular market

288
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,320
And people who are new to the field

289
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,620
but wanted some detail and wanted a case
study going all the way through it

290
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:39,490
They had a very good set of criteria that
had come from their marketing department

291
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,355
And again, that was interesting

292
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:44,970
because the marketing was
predominantly done in sort of India

293
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,340
It's interesting seeing this
these countries really take on board

294
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,721
systems engineering and, in particular
model-based systems engineering

295
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:58,090
I think that's a very encouraging
picture for MBSE globally

296
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,960
I bought your book but I must bet
I haven't read it yet

297
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't care
Change buy, Tim

298
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,899
The title "Demystifying Systems
Engineering" sounds a little bit like

299
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:18,479
You try to answer the the why question
"Why should I do the systems engineering?"

300
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:24,953
The "Demystified" is really
that's more from the publisher

301
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,974
I think it's a good title obviously

302
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:30,047
But they they do a series of
books called "Demystified"

303
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,584
which are aimed at this particular

304
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,620
And it's kind of like INCOSE UK

305
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,424
Now we have the "DON'T PANIC" books
which are a set at a higher level

306
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,379
But when they approached me

307
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:43,092
they sent me examples of what
some of the other ones were

308
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:46,250
But they were all about coding
so I couldn't really read them

309
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,405
So the title of that

310
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,840
And that was one of the things
that they came up with

311
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,837
But apart from that

312
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:57,090
they gave me quite a lot of
freedom in the book

313
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,880
to write what I wanted

314
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,170
It was a very good process
working with them

315
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,968
I took a short look into it

316
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,592
And it was interesting for me that

317
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:11,927
you are referring at the end or the
beginning of every chapter to

318
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:16,012
"How does it comply to ISO 15288?"

319
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,782
I think the the provenance
of engineering is very important

320
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:24,829
And I think the demonstration of
compliance is very important

321
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,309
I think increasingly for a
number of industries now

322
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,534
I'm the first to admit things
like ISO standards aren't perfect

323
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:36,345
But it gives us a good target to aim for

324
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:41,440
And one of the problems you'll get
is with model-based systems engineering

325
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,059
People want to say "How does it relate
to the way that we do things already?"

326
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,130
"How can it solve these problems for us?"

327
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,450
That was a very deliberate part of the
book is wherever possible are related

328
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,542
And it's something that we reflect
in our working philosophy anyway

329
00:18:55,542 --> 00:19:00,070
We try and relate it to what's
acknowledged as sort of best practice

330
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,369
And in the world today

331
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:04,337
the two big standards we use
in the book are obviously

332
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:07,560
15288 which is more of
the process side of things

333
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,126
but also the 42010
the associated standards

334
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:14,649
which are more about architecture
and architecture framework

335
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:19,112
But we use those as a central part
obviously of all the modelling that we do

336
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:20,399
Because when we do modeling

337
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,551
a large part of the book is advocating
creating a good framework for the model

338
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:28,509
We want to reference that
to best international practice

339
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,880
And I think the two standards
work well together

340
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,060
The standards aren't perfect by any means

341
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,790
But they're a really good
best practice model

342
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,590
They're acknowledged across the world

343
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,600
And it just gives you that
extra level of credibility

344
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,270
Because I know from my
experience, people will say

345
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,610
"But we do things like this already
how does MBSE help us?"

346
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,040
He's trying to preempt
that question if you like

347
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,330
"Say well, here's your
best practice model"

348
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,245
"You can use it to do this"
"you can use it to do this"

349
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:01,650
But what that also allows you to do
which is very interesting, is

350
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,658
I don't need to tell you two
about things like reuse

351
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:08,240
but for lots of people who don't
have a modeling background

352
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,008
this is quite big news to them

353
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,240
And when you can say
actually for this part of the ISO standard

354
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,674
remember that thing we did a while back

355
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,160
and we produced these views in this model

356
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,500
We can reuse those for this part as well

357
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,175
Things that we did in requirements

358
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:25,032
and we'd be doing scenario
modelling and things like that

359
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:27,980
We can reuse those now as
part of our acceptance testing

360
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,060
that we're now using as part of our V&V

361
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,142
It allows you to to do things like that

362
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,887
and to make these references back

363
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:38,344
And I think that's very important as well

364
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:42,250
because I don't want to
get too much into reuse

365
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,848
but reuse is one of those things

366
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:47,097
that I remember back in the
sort of mid-80s and early 90s

367
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:49,780
everything was about
reuse and object orientation

368
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,518
And there were a lot of myths, and a lot
of expectations that weren't quite met

369
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,122
But from a modeling point of view
I think reuses is very possible

370
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,511
when it's done properly

371
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,953
I think that was an important point
that we wanted to make as well

372
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,733
Again, the use of standards is a good

373
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:07,531
It gives us a good mechanism to show that

374
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:11,920
Particularly when it came to, there's one
chapter on management, for example

375
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,768
And almost all the views that 
we create in management

376
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,720
are based on the engineering views

377
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,144
And that's a nice exercise to do

378
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:23,520
And that's a point that we're often
trying to make to people as well is

379
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,390
"Why do we have these two
completely separate disciplines

380
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,940
that won't talk to one another?"

381
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,401
When actually we're all
looking at the same thing

382
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,871
and I think this is a classic problem
that we have in systems engineering

383
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:37,380
To me one of the biggest problems
that we have with systems engineering is

384
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,560
the word "Engineering"

385
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,223
Because it scares people away

386
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,578
Because people will say
"Well, I'm not an engineer

387
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:46,380
I can't possibly understand what you're
talking about, we do things differently"

388
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,114
Whereas if you say systems
thinking or a systems approach

389
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:50,738
everybody wants a systems approach

390
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,562
everybody wants a systems thinking

391
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,564
But you say systems engineering
people people run for the hills screaming

392
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,503
So, which can be a problem

393
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,600
I also have more and more
customers asking for ISO

394
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I think ISO provides more stable areas
in this very dynamic environment

395
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,144
It feels a little bit more safe

396
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:16,188
Many people ask me how to
map SYSMOD to ISO

397
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:17,922
SysML to ISO standard

398
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:19,427
And this is standard and so on

399
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,056
People like the the comfort of ISO as well

400
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:27,200
We used to have an expression in the UK
I'm sure it was worldwide

401
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
That said, "Nobody ever got
fired for buying IBM"

402
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,460
Right?

403
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,140
I won't comment on how valid
that is as a statement now

404
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,046
But it's that same philosophy which is

405
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:36,443
if you're referencing to ISO

406
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:40,088
you're not going to get into trouble
for complying with an ISO standard

407
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:43,502
Oh, that was my cat just
leaking up then making it

408
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:47,208
He's not a big fan of ISO as soon as
I mentioned that he leaves the room

409
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,720
I think it was also very interesting
what you said about the maturity of MBSE

410
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,126
I think in the past

411
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:06,686
tools and methods could do
much more than the people needed

412
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:10,266
But I think now we are in a change

413
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:15,393
and today people need more than
the tools and methodologies can provide

414
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:18,360
I couldn't agree to more with you, Tim

415
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Absolutely

416
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
And I think for so many years

417
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,408
I would say this is my personal opinion

418
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:27,299
not aimed at any particular tool vendor

419
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,870
But for so many years

420
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,520
we had tools that were doing so much
stuff that nobody would ever use

421
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,160
And it was never required

422
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,120
I mean who's ever wanted
shadows on their lines on the dark

423
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,710
And this is the sort of insanity

424
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,335
And all these different techniques

425
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:47,380
And marketing people tried
to convince we needed

426
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,400
Give us the basic functionality

427
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,520
But I think for many years, all tools
were way ahead of the game

428
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,698
and would be providing functionality
that people weren't using

429
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:01,640
But I think suddenly
now the last 5 years

430
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,830
I agree, Tim

431
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,668
I think now the tools
are playing catch up

432
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:09,271
And I think in some cases
they're focused on the wrong areas

433
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:12,880
But I think also like I said
we're living in a connected world

434
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,983
I think this idea of a single vendor
people who finally realizing

435
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,760
is not particularly realistic

436
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,994
Particularly when you work
in a big organization

437
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,090
when you work in a large company

438
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,391
you're going to be using multiple
tools from different vendors

439
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:31,919
And I think one of the biggest issues
at the moment is tool interoperability

440
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,840
So actually, you're using a
requirements tool for one vendor

441
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,900
You're using a system or modeling
tool from another vendor

442
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,970
We've then got a PLM environment
that somehow stakeholders together

443
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,750
we've got the mathematics and
the simulation side of things

444
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,926
And we need all these
things to work together

445
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:49,084
I think at the moment

446
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:53,214
most of the tools that I see on 
the market are shockingly bad

447
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:56,414
in this area of tool interoperability

448
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:57,715
And I think particularly

449
00:24:57,715 --> 00:25:01,310
in areas like the visual world of SysML

450
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,080
compared to the the formal
mathematical world of simulation

451
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,710
We've got mechanisms in SysML
that give us that bridge

452
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,980
things like parametric gives us a
natural bridge into those

453
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,971
But I think many of the tools
at the moment are terrible

454
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:19,050
to be quite frank in that area

455
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,080
I think this is an area that needs
to have a lot of improvement

456
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,674
And I also think that you look at
some tools and the usability of them

457
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:28,448
If you went back 10 or 15 years

458
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:32,283
it was the same with many industries

459
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:33,547
but software in particular

460
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:36,569
software was telling you what you wanted
the vendors were saying

461
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,929
"No, no, you should do that"

462
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,662
"You want to do it like this"

463
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:42,650
People aren't that willing
to accept that anymore

464
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,760
And I think using something
we did speak about briefly earlier

465
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,630
using a tool with an interface
that's 20 or 30 years old

466
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,380
that hasn't really moved on
is no longer good enough

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,775
I don't think some of
the vendors realize that

468
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:04,170
usability is such a big issue at the
moment because it really is

469
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,055
I would rather the vendors focused on
making the core functionality

470
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:14,000
very user-friendly and compatible
with other tools and so on

471
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,618
than having the equivalent of
windings on a modeling tool

472
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,910
which is essentially what
they're doing in many cases

473
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,699
But you think any other software
if it had an interface that old

474
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:30,880
you wouldn't go near it

475
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,116
But I really think that's a
big issue to my mind that

476
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:36,718
I think they're the two biggest
issues I have with them

477
00:26:36,718 --> 00:26:40,372
The first one at the moment is the
whole interoperability of the tools

478
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,776
And also the usability of them

479
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:47,682
And these things aren't cheap either
as we've just discussed before

480
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:52,170
They seem to be getting more
expensive as time goes on

481
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,681
And I think the the responsibilities
on the vendors now

482
00:26:55,681 --> 00:27:01,339
to actually produce something that's more
fit for purpose and many of the tools are

483
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:04,098
That's as diplomatic as
I can be about tools

484
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,481
We have two comments
in the live chat this time

485
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:14,243
One recommendation for your book
that "It's a great book by the way"

486
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:18,638
Thanks, mum!
She always joins in on these podcasts

487
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,790
We have a comment from Mark

488
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,265
who suggests that we just have to
rewrite the standards as models

489
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:30,350
This is a really important point

490
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,000
And it's something that I've been
I've spoken to ISO too

491
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,530
I've been involved with
ISO for a number of years

492
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,442
for years and years and years on

493
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:42,640
And one of the ways that we demonstrate
compliance is we model the standards

494
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,600
anybody with any modeling knowledge will
know that just the very act of modeling

495
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,928
gives you a very good indication on
how well-written something is

496
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,989
If something's very well written
and well specified in your model

497
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,818
it the model just falls out

498
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,159
And it's easy

499
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,280
If it's difficult to do the modeling
if there's a lot of ambient

500
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,290
it tells you about how badly written
the the source information is

501
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,496
And we've been doing this
for years and years

502
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:09,520
We've in fact one of the first

503
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,295
what we now refer to as the sort of
frameworks we use and so on

504
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:17,030
One of the first ones
that we produce back in

505
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,030
If in fact I'll tell you how long it was

506
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,890
I mentioned the first INCOSE
conference I went to is in 1999

507
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,647
the paper I presented was on
using UML to model standards

508
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:27,420
Right?

509
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,050
And because standards were so complex

510
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,950
look at standards
look at best practice models

511
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,188
there's hundreds of them
they're very complex

512
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:36,668
They all use different language

513
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:38,750
They're difficult to
communicate with people

514
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,290
People don't understand them

515
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,720
It's the perfect candidate
for modeling

516
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,670
It takes all the modeling boxes 
why you need to model

517
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:51,665
And why people don't define standard
using models is beyond me

518
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:52,819
and I've spoken to

519
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:55,723
not just I said to different
standards bodies before as well

520
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,020
You should be doing them like this

521
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,440
because it makes them far less ambiguous

522
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,016
it makes them easy to communicate

523
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:04,578
You can translate into different
languages far easier

524
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:09,599
I love you, Mark
That was an excellent point

525
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,586
I couldn't agree with you more

526
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:15,718
But also when it comes to compliance if we
model our own processes and frameworks

527
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:18,247
using the same technology
modeling techniques

528
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:21,460
that we then model our standards
within our best practice models

529
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,420
The compliance we can build
into the models in

530
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,837
and we can actually import
them into the tools

531
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:30,653
And the compliance is then
built into our overall model

532
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,241
To me, it's so obvious

533
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,615
Yet so few people do it

534
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:38,813
that's a really good observation

535
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,720
By the way, we started creating
a document generation

536
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,798
from the model for
the SysML 1 specification

537
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,360
And we found many inconsistencies
in the specification

538
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,520
And the previous SysML 1 versions 
and also the UML versions are

539
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,342
partly they are modeled

540
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:02,809
But most of the stuff 
is pure text document

541
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,263
In so many standards and particularly
if you do any working frameworks

542
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:14,287
things like the defense-based
architectural framework

543
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:18,626
So that, the MODAFs, the DoDAFs,
the DNDAFs, the NAFs, and so on

544
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:22,053
If you just do the most basic of
modelling on those

545
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:28,183
they expose themselves for the bag of
spanners that they really are

546
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:32,610
The model standards, model
best practice, references

547
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,780
whether it's in-house procedures
framework definitions

548
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,960
it will give you all sorts of insights
into what you're doing

549
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,741
And it gives you just a
really good indication

550
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,985
of how good the source material is

551
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,424
We have a very interesting discussion
in the chat about interoperability

552
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:55,587
And I guess we have to have it
as an own topic on another day

553
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:57,357
Definitely

554
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:58,353
Absolutely

555
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,849
But for now

556
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:03,510
I would like to change the topic 
a little bit on your professorship

557
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,303
You're teaching systems engineering

558
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:09,506
You're teaching at a university

559
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:15,008
Is it the only university where you can
have systems engineering lessons?

560
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,475
Or is it wider spread?

561
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:20,548
And what do I do when I'm a professional?

562
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,939
It's clear

563
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:27,037
It's the best taught
systems engineering in the UK

564
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:28,645
if not the world

565
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,363
But apart from that

566
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,658
we've seen an increase
in the number of

567
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,753
universities that are offering
systems engineering

568
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:39,623
And more important that we've
seen a big increase in the quality

569
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,471
And I think it's fair to say

570
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:44,298
if you went back 10 years
and you looked at universities

571
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:48,475
not all but some universities
they would look at systems engineering

572
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,300
We'll just take
a bit of mechanical

573
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,940
a bit of electrical
a bit of civil

574
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,975
a bit of software
or a bit of management

575
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:55,300
We'll mix it all together

576
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,052
And outcome's the systems
engineering degree for example

577
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:00,480
And what we're seeing now is actually

578
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,970
And to me, that's kind of a
master of none kind of approach

579
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,567
But what we're really seeing now
in the last 5 or 10 years

580
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:11,920
is universities creating
these courses from scratch

581
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,031
And then, bring again the modules
obviously reusing as and when

582
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:17,760
But actually

583
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,538
they're really holding very well together
as systems engineering courses

584
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:26,664
When it comes to modeling, and a
problem that I've often had with

585
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:27,980
which is good news for me

586
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,237
because one of the things
I do in Scarecrows

587
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:34,780
I teach modelling is people
are leaving university

588
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,357
And they've been taught
something like UML or SysML

589
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:40,433
But they've been taught by somebody
who's never used it in anger

590
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,810
They've been taught by
somebody who's read the spec

591
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,830
and understands it
and understands modeling

592
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,993
But as you both know, there's a big
difference between understanding

593
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:52,117
what the diamond means and
what should it be colored in an opera

594
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:54,407
And actually applying
this onto a real project

595
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,120
And I think that's very interesting

596
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,053
And that's what we've seen a lot of now

597
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,005
And I think also to be fair

598
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:02,960
it's why I was offered my
position in the first place

599
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,450
or one of the reasons it was offered
apart from the good looks

600
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,883
That's because I had lots of
industrial experience

601
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:12,720
And they wanted to bring that
they wanted to bring that into the course

602
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,760
And I think that's very important as well

603
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,897
we've seen a lot more
systems engineering being adopted

604
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:20,887
and we're also seeing a lot
more now that the default is

605
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:23,695
modelling is involved in it somehow

606
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:27,836
even if it's not full what
I call the stage 5 MBSE

607
00:33:27,836 --> 00:33:32,512
This modeling is an increasingly
important part of what we're doing

608
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,960
when it comes to systems engineering

609
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,638
I think the education system is improving

610
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,135
We do in and we have some working
groups with INCOSE UK to look at this

611
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:45,405
And in fact, I do work with

612
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:48,407
I've mentioned very briefly
the children's book that we wrote

613
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,656
But I do we have what
we call STEM in the UK

614
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,846
STEM is Science, Technology
Engineering, and Mathematics

615
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,820
And it's really promoting
things like engineering

616
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,070
For me obviously
it's all STEM but secretly

617
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,580
the 'E' part of the STEM
to school children

618
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,280
So, I'm also involved in doing well

619
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,566
I'm involved, I haven't been for the
last 15 months for obvious reasons

620
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:13,568
But I used to do a lot of
sort of evening lectures

621
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,698
science festivals
music festivals

622
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:18,269
I've got a music festival
coming up at the end of July

623
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:22,560
What I also do which you
probably most people don't know

624
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,735
Sings in SysML for me?

625
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,308
I'm also a magician as well as
being a systems engineer

626
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:33,921
I do science and music festivals

627
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:38,422
where I use magic to communicate 
systems engineering to people

628
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:42,380
We can talk about things, all the
things we talk about in modelling

629
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,637
good communication looking at
things from different points of view

630
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:47,750
visualization all these kinds of things

631
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,119
Visualization, the things that we
would think about in SysML

632
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,350
we can use as a basis for doing
memory acts and things like that

633
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,940
I can memorize a deck of cards

634
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,940
using the same visualization techniques

635
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,607
I used to model a car or
an airplane or a medical system

636
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:07,573
There's a lot more work being
done trying to get into younger

637
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:13,621
to convey engineering in particular
systems engineers obviously

638
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:16,900
My emphasis to the younger
generation as well

639
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,500
and because obviously you want to
get them before they go to universities

640
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,354
to try and get them excited
and kind of inspired in some way

641
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,152
And I think that's very important

642
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,880
And we're starting to see some
of that come through now

643
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,765
And it's also as a sign
of getting old as well

644
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:36,610
when I meet an enormous man
for example or a full grown woman

645
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,280
They say to me, "Oh, I saw you
when I was a child at a school"

646
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,640
It makes me feel happy inside

647
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,680
But old on the outside when
that sort of thing happens

648
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,049
I think it's important that
we can get it into universities

649
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,920
and improve the way we're doing that

650
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,572
But I also think it's important that
we can go before that and get children

651
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:03,719
A younger age because everybody's
naturally curious about things

652
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,760
And you mentioned "Engineering"
people switch off

653
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,497
You mention "Problem solving"
everybody gets excited

654
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:13,920
What's engineering if not problem solving?

655
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,120
We do it by at the simplest level 
drawing pictures of stuff

656
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,428
That's naturally how people work
That's naturally how people think

657
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:24,082
For some reason that gets
driven out of people's minds

658
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:28,769
to naturally think in images
and visualize things

659
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,719
as we go through the education system

660
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,206
Would you say that there's something
special about MBSE in the UK

661
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:43,574
compared to other countries
except Jon Holt?

662
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:48,881
This is what I get special

663
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:55,154
I don't know if it's particularly
special in the UK

664
00:36:55,154 --> 00:37:00,160
I think many countries
it's a big stereotype

665
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,554
but many companies have
a particular mentality

666
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:06,103
as well in the way that I go about
in the way they go about things

667
00:37:06,103 --> 00:37:08,983
What I've seen in the UK is

668
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:12,160
these mentalities can be
associated with industries

669
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,210
So again, I'm engineering space

670
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,675
if they were early adopters
of systems engineering

671
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,420
and model-based
systems engineering

672
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,600
but they broad generalization
far less open to new ideas

673
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,897
than you get automotive, medical devices
that they're coming to the party late

674
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:30,650
But they're having a very good
time when they get there

675
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,489
They're a lot more receptive to try and
change the way that they work, and so on

676
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:39,231
And I think that's the big thing to me
the big blocker with MBSE

677
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:42,203
It's the people, we often talk
about people processing tools

678
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,338
It's the people side of things

679
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:46,340
And it's winning that battle with people

680
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,916
It's getting them to be able
to see for themselves

681
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,962
rather than just tell them
"Do it this the way", "Do it this way"

682
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:54,075
it's great getting them
to see for themselves

683
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:57,009
and realize that actually this is
a good way to do things

684
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,347
And there are benefits in
it for different people

685
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,840
It's the attitude change

686
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,550
And I found that that's more
to do with the industries

687
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,038
than sort of geographically where we go

688
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,800
And it can also be

689
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,995
a younger generation coming through
tend to be more open to new ideas

690
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:19,930
than, and I include myself in this
old white middle-aged straight men

691
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,960
essentially, which is what the industry
is full of at the moment

692
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,984
But as we see more diversity in all
different areas coming through engineering

693
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:31,060
because I still think
we're behind on this

694
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,245
But I think a natural emergent
property of diversity

695
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:39,526
is people having a more open mind
and people being more receptive

696
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:46,480
to maybe slightly different or newer
ideas than people of older generations

697
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,800
And I think that's very important
I think the future's very bright

698
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,311
I think that's what we've got to focus
on is look at the future and say

699
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:56,607
"Can we inspire the next
generation of engineers?"

700
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:59,520
"What is it possible they can achieve?"

701
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,663
That's just with a more open mindset

702
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:04,517
and with open up the rise to
these different techniques

703
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:06,650
Things that have been taking me 30 years

704
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,430
to show to people who finally
get them to commence

705
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,609
what about people who
don't have to do that

706
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,940
who can just try out these
new ideas and new areas

707
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,320
And that the potential has got to 
be enormous across the world

708
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,020
One very funny thing is

709
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,400
if you follow Scarecrow
Consultants on LinkedIn

710
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,360
is that you publish every week 
a riddle "SysML-anary" on

711
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,443
song titles expressed in a SysML diagram

712
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:43,395
Fancastic!

713
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,040
I like puzzles
I like terrible jokes

714
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,185
I like music
I like films

715
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:50,406
There's a game

716
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:52,450
There's a very popular sort of parlor game

717
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,554
This called "Pictionary" which
is like picture dictionary

718
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:59,485
You draw pictures that
represent films and so on

719
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:03,120
And we started off as a bit
of a joke where it was well

720
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,200
When I do courses and
comments and things

721
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,535
I would say, "You can represent
any information using modeling

722
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,724
because it's just a way
to visualize things"

723
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:13,150
And people would say

724
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,010
"Can you do this?"
"Can you do this?"

725
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,650
It started off as a bit of a joke
doing things like that

726
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,425
But now we do it every Friday night
it's usually a film or a song

727
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:26,176
If it's a film, it might
be the film title

728
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,600
Or it might be, this week we've
actually got a scene from a film

729
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,850
that we've done with a sequence diagram

730
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,416
And we use SysML to visualize

731
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:39,586
either the title or some of
the lyrics of a song or whatever

732
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,800
occasionally we'll do it for people

733
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,010
very occasionally we'll
do it for a type of cheese

734
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,960
It really depends on what we do

735
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,270
But we've got quite a big
following on this now

736
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:54,203
And it's interesting
wherever I used to go

737
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,443
and will hopefully be going again soon
people come and approach me

738
00:40:57,443 --> 00:41:00,713
And I was in America
for example a few years ago

739
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:02,040
Rick Steiner came up to me

740
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,467
and he says every Friday we gather
the whole research group round

741
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:09,283
And we all see who can get it first
there's a bit of a competition going on

742
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:11,391
And it's really fascinating you just go

743
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:14,084
what really that terrible puzzle
that we do every week

744
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,140
But it's great, and it gets
people interested

745
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,822
And very occasionally people say
they learn a bit of SysML from it as well

746
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:25,077
But I think it's getting people
thinking in an abstract way

747
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:29,775
It's not just about designing the new aero
plane, the new car, the train, or whatever

748
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:33,645
You can use these techniques to
convey any kind of information

749
00:41:33,645 --> 00:41:36,149
And in fact it was
Rick Steiner that said to me

750
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:38,293
which really stuck in
my mind, he said

751
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:43,593
"You can only truly master any language
if you can express humor in it"

752
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:46,640
And he said that's
what SysML does

753
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,110
He uses that as an example
for some of his students

754
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,020
And I think that's very important

755
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,361
if you do go onto our
LinkedIn page and you do this

756
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:56,720
you have to go with an open
mind, and bear in mind

757
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,697
There are some terrible
misinterpretations

758
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:03,810
of song titles and
things like that on it

759
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,804
But we do that every Friday

760
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:09,145
It's a good fun thing to come along
And join in if you do

761
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:10,658
And if you're very lucky

762
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:14,080
you might even have it
dedicated to you one week

763
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,320
That's the goal, Tim

764
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,920
Last week it reminds me of a great film

765
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,119
Very good

766
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,317
Is it correct that you published
some of them in a book?

767
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,000
When we go to conferences and things
we'll collect like a year together

768
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,690
And just print them in a book

769
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,937
We normally give them out
just as like a free thing

770
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,875
And people tend to like it

771
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,616
And then we give match prizes
and things like that as well

772
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:50,701
But we print them through
an online publishing company

773
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,140
And so just for a joke, Simon

774
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,989
one of my colleagues where
I write a lot of the books with

775
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,292
He said "Oh, we'll just put
it up for 5 pounds

776
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:00,450
and see if anybody's
stupid enough to buy it"

777
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,520
"Somebody in Canada bought 50 copies!"

778
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,957
Okay, it's full with money as
they say ain't hardly a fall at all

779
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:11,374
But people want the hard copy
just send me an email

780
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:12,590
We will send you some out

781
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,167
We give those away at conferences

782
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,750
And things like that we don't
normally charge for those

783
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,330
But it's normally just like the last year
that we've done and put together

784
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,530
It's kind of nice just to have them

785
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,630
No need to copy it from LinkedIn?

786
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:29,440
Yeah, come and see us
at the next conference

787
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,563
And you can have a signed copy

788
00:43:32,563 --> 00:43:36,532
with a personalized message
in SysML especially for you

789
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,130
What's your next conference?

790
00:43:40,405 --> 00:43:44,224
The next face-to-face one
I'm doing is hopefully

791
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:48,652
the INCOSE UK annual systems engineering
conference in November of this year

792
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:51,572
That obviously takes place in the UK

793
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:55,147
I'm heavily involved in that
I'm the technical director

794
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:58,910
I'm responsible for getting your papers
reviewed and all the technical content

795
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,730
That'll be the next one that we're at

796
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,400
I'm appearing at some quite a few online
ones over the next 12 months as well

797
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,494
I've got quite a few German
events coming up actually

798
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:12,320
You're the first of many German
events that are coming up

799
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,943
If you like this, come and see me
say to the others

800
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,517
I'll be saying the same thing

801
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:20,340
but with a slightly different hat
on maybe or something like that

802
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,970
But so there's quite a few coming up

803
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,464
I mean one of the good things
under COVID is

804
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:29,129
I get invited to a lot more
international conferences than I used to

805
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:33,979
It's not quite as sad as much so far
and imagining that I'm in Paris in this

806
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:39,605
I was supposed to go to Paris as one of
the keynotes in December at Christmas

807
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:44,280
I thought that would be great and take
my girlfriend we'll have a lovely time

808
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,304
and we didn't instead, we sat here,
and drank red wine on that evening

809
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:51,600
and pretended that we were in Paris

810
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,689
Not quite the same

811
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:54,062
Sounds good

812
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:55,735
Great, okay!

813
00:44:55,735 --> 00:45:01,280
We are live for now 42 minutes

814
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,125
I have still three tasks for our listeners

815
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,640
The one is give us a thumbs up on YouTube

816
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,705
You can support the channel

817
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:13,092
Don't forget to subscribe to the channel

818
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:17,497
You don't miss out the next live stream

819
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:21,570
And last but not least
buy the book of Jon

820
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:22,422
Yes!

821
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,640
Not just that one!
All of them, all 17 books!

822
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,016
If you buy all 17 books
I'll give you free "SysML-anary"

823
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:32,703
Great!

824
00:45:32,703 --> 00:45:33,703
And Tim

825
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:39,289
Then the next topic is not planned yet

826
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:43,600
We have some ideas but we have
no next topic, no date yet

827
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,197
And also a little bit summer break time

828
00:45:46,197 --> 00:45:50,960
But we will do something pretty sure

829
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,097
And I think that's it

830
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:57,280
I'd just like to say thanks to
both Christian and Tim

831
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,467
for inviting me on

832
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,696
It's been a delight

833
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:02,400
And I'd also like to say very sincerely

834
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,630
Good luck in the football tomorrow night

835
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,705
To you and everybody in Germany

836
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,720
Now you have to watch the YouTube video

837
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,449
if you are just listening on it
to see what Jon really meant

838
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:22,730
We could also spoil
the result for tomorrow

839
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,210
I know it

840
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,945
Jon, also from my side
was an honor to have you here

841
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:33,392
Thank you very much

842
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,010
I look forward to seeing you both 
in person in the next year

844
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,751
