work but now mainly giving trainings on

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
systems engineering

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
for people who either just want to get

46
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,760
more proficient in systems engineering

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
or want to get certified either to the

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
incosi standard or to the se3 standard

49
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
which was developed here in germany

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
discussing with all of the experts in

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
the area of systems engineering so this

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
is the way how i ensure so to say that

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
i'm then i'm up to date in order to

69
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159

yeah great

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
so um

73
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,239
we are together here today mainly for

74
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
iso 5288 and we prepared some questions

75
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
and to all our live listeners if you

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,799
have questions for david just use the

77
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
live chat feature from youtube so you

78
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,480
can ask

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
questions and

80
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,680
we will

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
ask them to dub it

82
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,239
yeah david first question

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,200
uh

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
you're working or volunteering for iso

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
how did you come to iso

86
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
i otherwise there was a couple of years

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
ago when i was serving as the technical

88
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
director for the for the german chapter

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
of incosi and we had a very interesting

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
um talk at our presentation

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
at one of the national symposia from the

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,919
gfse the german chapter of inkosi

93
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
and it was introduced here that there

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
you can meet some some experts to

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
discuss so let's say the uh the current

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
divisions or in future revisions of uh

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,639
systems editing standards

98
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
so i volunteered yeah through gfse to

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
become a member of dean yeah which is

100
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,600
german national body for standardization

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
and um

102
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
and when i was just

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
getting more and more involved

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
the nkosi asked me if i'd be interested

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
in becoming their technical director

106
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,720
so i said okay i'm a freelancer so it's

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
i can do either or but i cannot do both

108
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
at the same time yeah because i also

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
must earn some money yeah so and then i

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,199
said

111
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360
okay let's uh let's quote it so to say

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
on hold

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
the work for dean and iso

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
and after i served for four years in

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
total on the in cosi board of directors

116
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
so let's say i was just right in time to

117
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
become uh involved again

118
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
in the standardization work for the new

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
update of 1528

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
which was then kicked off someone last

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
year so there was a slight overlap

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
but it was still okay because i was

123
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
already preparing my retirement from

124
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
from ecosystem

125
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
so

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
we just call it 1528 and sometimes we

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
call it iso 5288 but the full name is

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,080
iso iec ieee 1528

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
so but is it an iso standard or is it an

130
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,520
iec standard or is it an ieee standard

131
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,240
and

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
but who is iso and

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
why can they publish standards and who's

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
iec and who's

135
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
ieee and how they are connected so can

136
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
you clarify that a bit

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,400
uh

138
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
yes of course although there's a lot of

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,639
questions

140
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
yeah

141
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
okay so um so first person i guess was

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
um

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
who owns so to say the standard so it's

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
all three of those standardization

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
organizations they work together so iso

146
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
is the international standardization

147
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,720
organization yeah with a lot of

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,960
different standards

149
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,919
iec is a little more specialized yeah in

150
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,600
for in terms of electronic comedies so

151
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
which means they are more related

152
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,120
to technical

153
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,080
standards uh ieee as well which is the

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
institute for electric electrical and

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
electronics engineers or something like

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,759
that yeah please forgive me if i mix it

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,960
up slightly

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
because we're just talking with those

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
evasions normally and uh not exactly

160
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
knowing what the aggregations mean

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
however all three of them they now work

162
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
together and they send their experts in

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
order to come up so let's say that the

164
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,240
the most beneficial wordings for the for

165
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,720
the end users

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,680
and

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,639
it is

168
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
currently

169
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
oh it depends on how how you do the

170
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
counting so the first version was

171
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
developed in 2002

172
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
uh then it was updated in 2008

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
and in 2004 i guess it was adopted by

174
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
ieee

175
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
and so then the 2008 version was already

176
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,400
um

177
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,199
sorry with ieee involvement

178
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,000
and the

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,319
2015 version was the first one when it

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,840
was iso iec i triple e now so therefore

181
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
so let's say the counter was reset to

182
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
zero you know to one

183
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
uh which means that the 2015 version was

184
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
the second revision

185
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,479
even though it was already third or

186
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
fourth yeah depending on how you count

187
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
and now it's the the 2015 version is the

188
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
one that is still up to date so to say

189
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
the last one it was reapproved

190
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
and now we're working on the 20

191
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,680
probably 2023 version that is about the

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
date when we expect that it will be

193
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,599
approved in about march time frame

194
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
so to say

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
one year from now

196
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
uh yes that's right yeah

197
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,440
okay

198
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
yeah david

199
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,400
so maybe not everybody is

200
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
is

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
familiar with the 5288 in depth so could

202
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
you give us a rough overview what the

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
content of 15 288

204
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah sure so 15 to 88 is on on system

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
lifecycle processes

206
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
which means that it contains all of

207
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
those processes that you need as a

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
company

209
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
in order to build successful systems

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
so this comprises more than just

211
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
technical expertise so of course you

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
need to be very proficient in in the way

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
you're working and where you're

214
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
developing your your systems

215
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,600
and this is the area uh we all know very

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
well with the requirements

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
engineering with architecture definition

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
integration verification validation and

219
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
it ends with the disposal so the full

220
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
life cycle

221
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,519
is defined in this standard

222
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
but again this is not enough to be

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
successful on the market yeah so you

224
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,519
also have to manage your systems in

225
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
terms of technical management so you

226
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
have to apply something like project

227
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,880
management processes you know like

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
technical planning

229
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
uh configuration management risk

230
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
management decision management

231
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
so all of that must

232
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
work hand in hand with the with the

233
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
engineering activities

234
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
and in addition you also need to be on

235
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
the market which means that no company

236
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
that i know of is a has a depth of 100

237
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
which means you need to acquire some

238
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
systems or services that you need to

239
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
build your your systems

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
and at the same time of course you have

241
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,320
to bring your systems to the market

242
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
so acquisition and supply are grouped

243
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
under the so-called agreement processes

244
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,079
and then every company even my company

245
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
even though i'm just it's only me

246
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
working on several projects in parallel

247
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,560
yeah which means that you have something

248
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
have to have something like an

249
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
overarching uh project management uh for

250
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
all those different projects going on at

251
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,480
the same time

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
which is a so-called portfolio

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
management yeah giving priorities to

254
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
different projects in your organization

255
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
you need to have something like

256
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
knowledge management and quality

257
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
management system

258
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
so in all of these processes yeah all

259
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
together they form what we call the

260
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
organizational project enabling

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,839
processes

262
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
and all of that is

263
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,920
is part of 15 to 88 and this gives you a

264
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
full

265
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,959
overview of all the processes that you

266
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,200
need in order to be successful on the on

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
the on the market so this is in in brief

268
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,440
what is contained in 15 to 88

269
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
oh that sounds quite large so do you

270
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
know how thick the document is the

271
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
specification document the pdf how many

272
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
pages

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
uh it's a little bit more than 100 pages

274
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
if i remember right so the the content

275
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
is is it is rather sharp yeah so

276
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
it is not the case that this really uh

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
that you want to learn something about

278
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
systems engineering this is probably not

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
the document you should go for yeah

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,560
because

281
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
you need to have a lot of background

282
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
information on why certain things are in

283
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
there and how exactly it's meant to be

284
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,120
so it's not really a guide

285
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
but there's some there's some other

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,959
standards which do a much much better

287
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,399
job for example ieee 12 uh 12 207

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,680
was the uh

289
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
was the document that 15 to 80 days is

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
based on

291
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
and this had a lot of more examples how

292
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,240
to really implement how we do things

293
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
until then 15 to 88 so to say brought it

294
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
on on a next higher level

295
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,320
um okay yeah yeah just by coincidence we

296
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,279
have a

297
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
very good question uh also on on the

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
same topic so to say so one of our

299
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
listeners asks uh

300
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
should

301
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
uh very small entities uh

302
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,519
adopt 15 to 88 or should they better go

303
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
to 29 110

304
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,959
and

305
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
um how are those standards related are

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
the same people behind it uh

307
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,399
can you say something to that oh yeah

308
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
sure um so it's uh it's not really

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
exactly the same people behind it but it

310
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
is from the same working group within

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
iso yeah so therefore uh we have to pay

312
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
a lot of attention that those standards

313
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
are perfectly aligned

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
and

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
it really depends on your organization

316
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
yeah so if you're if you're used to

317
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,279
adapting um standards to your own

318
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,040
organization yeah so then uh 29 110 is

319
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
uh is perfectly fine

320
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,639
yeah it's an it's a huge series of um of

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,000
standards now with several sort of

322
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
cases here so depending on the size of

323
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
your company and the area you're working

324
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
in yeah they have different profiles i

325
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,519
guess they uh

326
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
that's in the right name

327
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,399
and then you have to pick the right

328
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,639
processes out of that and they are fully

329
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
aligned with 15 to 88 yeah so this is uh

330
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
that works perfectly fine

331
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
if you have no experience yeah in how to

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
tailor and how to adapt processes to

333
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
your own organization

334
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
it probably is easier to use 15 288

335
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,040
instead of 29 110 because you have to

336
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
find your way through

337
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,040
it's not really a jungle those processes

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
but you have to be a little more

339
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,199
experienced and how to adapt and how to

340
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,760
tailor standards to your organization

341
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
okay thank you

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
well i think you mentioned that uh the

343
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,760
first version of 5288 was published 2004

344
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,959
2002 or so and was it completely

345
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
developed from scratch or is it a

346
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
successor to to another standard

347
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
of course they didn't start from from

348
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
from scratches a lot of experienced

349
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
people were involved in the time so it

350
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,199
was more like so the same when when i

351
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
was just starting my systems using

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
careers i don't have full background on

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
how it really was involved

354
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,760
but the first one that i know of was was

355
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
mil standard 499

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
which was the first system engine

357
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
standard that was out there it was then

358
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
developed there wasn't was an ansi

359
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
standard on systems engineering so there

360
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
was a lot of pre-work already done

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
before

362
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,440
and 15-88 was the first version so to

363
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
say putting pulling together all of

364
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
those different threads out there

365
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
and then finally um iso convinced all of

366
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,680
the other

367
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
uh leading organizations to participate

368
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
in this effort

369
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
uh like in cozy like ieee and iec

370
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
and they all joined forces for the for

371
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,560
the 2008 version uh which was then so to

372
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
say the first one that was really uh so

373
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
let's say a common work within all of

374
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
the

375
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,560
different standardization organizations

376
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
okay but

377
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,800
what i don't really get is why is 5288

378
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,440
so important for systems engineering so

379
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
or

380
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
ask the other way around

381
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
can i apply systems engineering without

382
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
looking into 15 to 88

383
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,680
uh

384
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
definitely yes yeah so this one this one

385
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
just gives you so to say the framework

386
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
for your organization yeah it doesn't

387
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
really tell you how to really say in

388
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
detail apply

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
model-based systems engineering or

390
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
systems engineering it describes more or

391
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,519
less only the activities and tasks that

392
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
should be implemented in your your

393
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,040
organization

394
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
of course if you have something that

395
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
that has proven to work in the past yeah

396
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,759
it's always all it's all about tailoring

397
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,560
so yeah please never ever just take

398
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
fifteen to eighty eight and say oh now

399
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,639
we got a new standard process or

400
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,199
development process and this simply just

401
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,720
won't work

402
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
uh so therefore depending on your um on

403
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
the history of your organization

404
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
depending on your culture

405
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,639
and a few other things

406
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
um just look out for those chunks and

407
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,680
parts that you that you see oh we're

408
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
missing something here yeah then 1528

409
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
could really be a good benefit

410
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
but of course we all know that in

411
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
systems typically everything interacts

412
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
with everything else

413
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
so which means sometimes it's very

414
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
difficult just to cut out a few pieces

415
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,839
because all of that is somewhat

416
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,600
interconnected and in many cases it just

417
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,560
makes more sense to really adapt very

418
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
closely to 15 to 88

419
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
but at the same time what i always tell

420
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
my customers

421
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
make sure that you're using the right

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
language so say your language the

423
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
language of your organization

424
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
and make it work in a way that your

425
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,000
people will accept it

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
and therefore sometimes it may take two

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
maybe even three steps

428
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,920
um before you fully implemented 15 to 88

429
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
but i can imagine because it's very very

430
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
general a lot of companies out there

431
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,119
already comply to 1588 maybe without

432
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,799
knowing it yeah so that's

433
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
that's what i discover very often

434
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
but this is possible that that i as a

435
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
project can prove that i work according

436
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,160
to 15 to 88 so are there any assessments

437
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
and i can achieve uh 15 to 88 level 3 or

438
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,919
something like that or certificates

439
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
and i think this could be important for

440
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
for tenders for example no that is

441
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
requested that the company works

442
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
according to fishing 288 things like

443
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
that

444
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,679
uh yes of course and and and iso is uh

445
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
is also building their own business case

446
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
so to say yeah therefore they have uh

447
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,919
they've put together another iso

448
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,679
standard on on assessment of 1528 and uh

449
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,919
m12 207 which is so to say the other

450
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,320
standard on software engineering or

451
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
software system

452
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,640
development

453
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
and this is uh 33004

454
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,600
yeah from the 2015 version

455
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,559
which was just a remut 2020 so it's

456
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
still valid you know without any any

457
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
changes and this gives you guidance on

458
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
how to build all of those assessments

459
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
and uh how to prove that you're working

460
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
according to 15 to 88 yeah so again the

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
number it's 33004

462
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
yeah that's that's the one that you look

463
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,840
up

464
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
and of course you pay for that one again

465
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
and then you have to find companies yeah

466
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
there are many out there

467
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
typical suspects i would say

468
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,799
um that can help you in order to make

469
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,520
this process assessment and then you get

470
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,799
certified as an as a company or as an

471
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,320
organization that you're working

472
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
according to 1528

473
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
okay

474
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,039
so we already talked about uh the

475
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
version 2008 2015 and

476
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
you already mentioned that the next

477
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,720
version will

478
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
most likely be 2

479
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
20 23.

480
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
um

481
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,919
so can you give us some insights what

482
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
will the biggest changes of the new

483
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
version

484
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
um

485
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
as mentioned before is as a document

486
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,880
exists or for quite some time it's not

487
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
really a revolution so to say yeah so

488
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,320
there's no new processes were added

489
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,640
which always makes people very nervous

490
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
yeah when new processes are added

491
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
because then they are all of a sudden

492
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
yeah you are certified according to 15

493
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,919
to 88

494
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,600
then there is a new process and then you

495
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
have to make sure that you align again

496
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,480
with this that new standard

497
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
the only

498
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
change let me say on this on this very

499
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,280
high level was that one process was

500
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
slightly renamed from architecture

501
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
definition to system architecture

502
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
definition

503
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
which may seem that's really pretty

504
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
trivial and straightforward but it was a

505
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
huge discussion behind it yeah so

506
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
and uh um can maybe if

507
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
we can do it in in in another podcast

508
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,559
yeah because it will build at least one

509
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,679
hour or so

510
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,760
but anyway um

511
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,159
um they say look at it as in so they say

512
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,960
as an user of 1528

513
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,039
of course and since the last version is

514
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
from 2015

515
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
some other standards that are that are

516
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
referenced by 15 288 have been updated

517
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
in the meantime yeah like 16 or 85

518
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
which is the

519
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
standard on on risk management yeah and

520
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,360
this one has been updated in the

521
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,919
meantime so therefore change is done to

522
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
this one but now also implemented in

523
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
1528

524
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
same is true for configuration

525
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
management and some some other areas

526
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,000
and mainly was them just as let's say

527
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
maybe minor minor changes you know to

528
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
some of the some of the contents

529
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
some of the things that we experienced

530
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
very often because of course the editors

531
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
on a regular basis they get feedback

532
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
also from the from the user community

533
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
and what we what we experience it very

534
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
often the concept of enabling system

535
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,880
into operating system in interfacing

536
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
systems was not very well understood

537
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,360
yeah so therefore we also expanded this

538
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,559
section

539
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,720
we gave some more explanation

540
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,480
about the concept definition you know

541
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
the very early stages of an of a project

542
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,679
so all of that is non-normative yeah

543
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,080
these are just the informative clauses

544
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
for the for the normative clauses yeah

545
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
and there was uh i say all these only

546
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
these these minor changes

547
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,039
like adding logistics to the maintenance

548
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,559
process as an example yeah it's um

549
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,120
in detail when you want to comply to 15

550
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,919
to 88 there's a there's some changes in

551
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,400
there but not too much you know so those

552
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
pros those organizations which are

553
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,080
currently certified according to the 15

554
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,960
1588 processes from 2015 it shouldn't be

555
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
a very big deal for them you know to

556
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,320
switch to the 2023 version

557
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,039
that's good news

558
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,240
yeah but

559
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,679
only it's something that you might be

560
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,679
very interested in is that we have a new

561
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,799
nxd which is also informative which is

562
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,240
that is uh some information on

563
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,960
model-based systems engineering yeah

564
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
something that was

565
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,080
that is new to this version

566
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
some other stuff was then just kicked

567
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
out because it was seen no longer to be

568
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,559
that

569
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,559
that important so to say

570
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,360
and this standard elaborates yeah on the

571
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,200
benefits of uh

572
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
of uh following a model based approach

573
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
to do assistant engineering yeah it

574
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
explains in more detail all of the

575
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
benefits that you have from from using a

576
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,679
model-based approach

577
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
for example in the very early stages

578
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
yeah and that you have a better uh

579
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
traceability that you have higher

580
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,240
consistency within all of your data sets

581
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,480
so all of all of that is now included in

582
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
15 to 88

583
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,520
i'm introducing um so or encouraging all

584
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
of the companies to do all of their

585
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
development model based

586
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,679
yeah i'm sure that was one of the big

587
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,240
criticisms on the current versions

588
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,200
uh that you did not have a link to mbse

589
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,480
does it provide a definition of mbse

590
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,000
uh in the very in the very first

591
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
sentence yes and i i knew they were

592
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,679
asking that

593
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
that one but it's not something because

594
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
tim you did some some some research and

595
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
very dis defined so so

596
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
nothing new yeah so it's it's still this

597
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,679
uh

598
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
this one the same one sentence and so to

599
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
say we we didn't dear uh as as iso

600
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
editors or as editors of 50 28

601
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
um let me say to start a huge

602
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,840
conversation and and discussion on on

603
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
the definition of model-based systems

604
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
engineering

605
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,440
okay

606
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
i try to have a look into the new

607
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,640
standards and open the iso website and

608
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
where the new standard is already listed

609
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
and i saw that uh now there's another

610
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
abbreviation added to the long name so

611
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,080
it's now it's an iso iec ieee dis 5288

612
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,919
standard so what is the meaning of dis

613
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,320
dis stands for draft international

614
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
standard

615
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,799
which means that

616
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,200
this one is now in in draft so it has

617
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
gone through a so-called working draft

618
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
stage so this was this was the very

619
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
first one so this is the stage where you

620
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
can do

621
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,120
so to say a lot of changes to the

622
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,279
standards yeah so you don't you don't

623
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,679
have to explain anybody

624
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,120
that's not really the case but the

625
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,679
editors have have some some freedom in

626
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,159
order to introduce new material

627
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,080
um all of that was based in a so-called

628
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,480
ad hoc group yeah so

629
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
i put together an ad hoc group of

630
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,840
experts

631
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
and asked them so please make uh propose

632
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
some changes to 15 28 that reflect

633
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,919
the current state of the practice

634
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,480
so the at the iso standards they always

635
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
reflect state of the practice and not

636
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
state of the art yeah which means that

637
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840
everything that's so to say that's

638
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,640
already well known in industry that is

639
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
what comes into the standards

640
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
so it's not that much future looking as

641
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
maybe some uh some some some other

642
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,000
publications

643
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
and it really defines what is what is

644
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,440
currently done by many organizations um

645
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,679
in in the world

646
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,760
and from there on so they say then we

647
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,360
attached the so-called working draft

648
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,159
version with a lot of changes on we

649
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
implemented already a lot of the changes

650
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
i just mentioned

651
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,480
and then

652
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,960
it goes through the so-called cd phase

653
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
which are the commenting drafts which

654
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
are then sent out to all of the national

655
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,520
bodies yeah so here in germany that's

656
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,559
that's dean and upno in france and and

657
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,840
all of the others

658
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,760
and there's a voting behind it yeah so

659
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,000
there's a bulletin and you have comments

660
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,159
then you have to as editors we have to

661
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,640
do the so-called comments disposition so

662
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
we have to answer each and every comment

663
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,039
you know either accept or accept in

664
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,000
principle uh defer or we can also reject

665
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,919
them yeah but all of that needs to be

666
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,480
justified and then there's a huge iso

667
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
meeting again where all of these

668
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
dispositions are

669
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
discussed and then it moves on to the

670
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,320
next stage

671
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,960
and bis so to say

672
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
uh it's the is last one you know so

673
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,679
after this and it's a final uh draft

674
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,400
international standard so called fdis

675
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
and there it's only allowed to do very

676
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,559
really very minor changes you know like

677
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,760
some

678
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
spelling arrows and and things like that

679
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,039
but no longer no more uh technical

680
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,159
comments yeah if you say oh i'm unhappy

681
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,320
with the way how you deal uh how you

682
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,400
treat mbse

683
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,720
and we of course we collect it but it

684
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,080
will be then for the next revision in

685
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
2031 also

686
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
and can anyone file an issue or change

687
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,840
requests or

688
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
is it only possible through the national

689
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,080
parties like dean

690
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,159
yeah so this is so it's mainly for the

691
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,799
for the national bodies like like in

692
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,240
um and of course the dean

693
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,640
representatives very often they are also

694
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,679
asked to involve other experts as needed

695
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,600
yeah but they of course need to justify

696
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,760
and make sure that those people do not

697
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
distribute the

698
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,080
document with with everybody

699
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
and um

700
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
and then there's also so-called liaison

701
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
partners for example in cosy as a

702
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
so-called liaison partner which means

703
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
that they can provide comments but they

704
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,919
have no voting rights you know so they

705
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,600
cannot vote they cannot approve or

706
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
disapprove the whole document

707
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
but they provide a lot of experts and of

708
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
course they have a certain certain

709
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,679
standing in the um

710
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,399
in stabilization and in their treatment

711
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,360
on on systems engineering in general

712
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,279
which means that these comments are

713
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,520
treated just like any other

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,720
um comment from

715
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
from one of the national bodies

716
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
okay so if i'm interested in filing an

717
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
issue or change requests

718
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
um i should ask my

719
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,159
local chapter often cosy

720
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
right and then they

721
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,520
can help me

722
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
uh yeah

723
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,520
so so we within cosy there's a so-called

724
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
standards development department

725
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
i found it or which was put in place at

726
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
the time and i was the technical

727
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
director

728
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
and they are organizing all of the

729
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
reviews on the on the various

730
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
international standards uh very

731
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,399
inclusive intends to participate

732
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,360
in the in in the commenting phase

733
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,039
so yeah if you're interested get in

734
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
touch with the leader of the standard

735
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,480
development department

736
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,159
which is currently richard martin from

737
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,600
the usa

738
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,039
but his

739
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,120
deputy is daniel

740
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,679
from daniel's eagle from liberty yeah so

741
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,720
he's from austria at least

742
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,559

yeah so

748
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,240
david i guess you are not writing the

749
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
standard alone

750
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
so

751
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,880
who else is on on this committee

752
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
so when we when when we started um it

753
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,159
was it was gary roedler leading the the

754
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
whole effort yeah um probably a lot of

755
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,480
people know gary rhoden and very very

756
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
experienced systems engineer he's an

757
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,200
cozy pioneer he's a nicosie fellow and

758
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,840
he's a lot of uh i'd say he's an esep

759
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,399
yeah so he he sort of say he achieved

760
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,440
all of the

761
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
certificates and and recognitions that

762
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,520
he can achieve in your your life as an

763
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,960
assistant engineer

764
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,279
and it is really it's really a big honor

765
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
for me uh working together with him

766
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,000
so he was leading the ad hoc team yeah

767
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
together with gerald jones also from the

768
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,039
united states and bill bearden who at

769
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,480
the same time is also a so-called

770
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,919
convener in in iso which means that he

771
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,240
oversees all of these standards within

772
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,159
the working group seven uh which is the

773
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
one on on on system life cycles

774
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
and uh from france yeah so it was a team

775
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,919
five of us we developed this uh this

776
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,679
this draft version

777
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,159
of course based on a couple of ideas

778
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
that we came up as a team

779
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
uh but also a lot of inputs that we

780
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,640
received yeah from from an iso meeting

781
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
where all of the national bodies

782
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
collected some ideas yeah so this is

783
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
what we brought forward

784
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
and then we worked ourselves through the

785
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,279
working draft the cd1 and cd2 and there

786
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,760
were two commenting drafts out there

787
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
and then gary decided because he's now

788
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,720
he now retired from from lockheed martin

789
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,799
and he said okay i want to get rid of

790
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,080
let me say getting all of these

791
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,399
involvements in cozy and iso and

792
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,720
everything so he asked me if i'd be

793
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,240
willing to take over as a project editor

794
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
in order to ensure yeah that all of his

795
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
knowledge is transferred to the next

796
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
generation yeah so so again it's a it's

797
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
a big honor for me to take over from

798
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,159
from gary

799
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,159
at the moment not really sure but i can

800
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,919
fill his footsteps you know because this

801
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,760
is really extremely hard

802
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
um but it's it's really it's a lot of

803
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,399
fun working with that that team they are

804
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,720
all so experienced and for me it's uh

805
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
like every meeting is just like waking

806
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
up and say

807
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
wow here thank you for sharing all of

808
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,440
that knowledge with me and trying to

809
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
learn as much as possible

810
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
knowing that in the next revision it

811
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
might be me then leading others uh to

812
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,200
the next revision of 15 28.

813
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,120
so and another important publication

814
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,399
systems engineering is definitely the

815
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,559
incosi handbook and if i open the it

816
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
goes handbook well it's it's full of

817
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
processes process descriptions uh so it

818
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,880
looks like that iso 5288 is also

819
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,600
described in the in the handbook and

820
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,480
um

821
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,159
is it fully covered in the handbook or

822
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,080
is it an interpretation of the iso

823
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
standards or what's what's the

824
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
relationship

825
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
so the the handbook an exhibition which

826
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
will also then be published in 2023

827
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,519
um

828
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,600
of course this is fully aligned with 15

829
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,679
to 88 and

830
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,519
this is done by just ensuring that the

831
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
same people work on

832
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,399
that work on 15 28 are also involved in

833
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,240
working on the handbook so gary reuter

834
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,600
is also an editor of the incosi handbook

835
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,159
and i was also just accepted as another

836
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,640
editor of the incosi handbook the next

837
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,559
revision which will then be

838
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,600
released and i say probably a couple of

839
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,559
months later than 1528

840
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,360
and

841
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
and of course yeah the description in

842
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,840
there it fully covers 15 to 88 from all

843
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
the processes that are described in 15

844
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
to 88 but it also elaborates a little

845
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,200
bit more on those on those processes so

846
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,919
it's got more than 400 pages yeah

847
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,120
it adds a couple of more details and

848
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,880
descriptions and best practices and

849
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
common approaches and tips and and all

850
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,880
of that is also part of the cozy

851
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,919
handbook

852
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
plus some material that is that is not

853
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,880
covered at all by 1528

854
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
um

855
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,399
like let me say in more detail about the

856
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,120
so-called quality characteristics yeah

857
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,600
like system safety and

858
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,799
environmental considerations

859
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,799
and all of that was formally known as

860
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,720
the so-called ilities but

861
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,240
today it's called more the quality

862
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
characteristics

863
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,559
so is it sufficient to read the in cozy

864
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
handbook or

865
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
do i have any value if i also read the

866
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,799
the standard

867
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,640
uh it depends on your use case so to say

868
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,720
if you want to be compliant with the 15

869
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,120
to 88 processes there is no other way

870
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,559
just to

871
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,640
to purchase 15 to 88

872
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,960
because it's not really cop one to one

873
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,919
copy

874
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,679
because uh in cosi doesn't have the

875
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,880
right to copy so to say 15 to 88 they

876
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
only may take the purpose of each

877
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
process and then the the activities but

878
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,320
not the tasks which is the more details

879
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,000
um a description of what exactly to do

880
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,799
and also 15-28 has only the process

881
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,120
outcomes so to say yeah which is more

882
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,519
general first in cozy handbook has a

883
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,840
so-called process outputs yeah so

884
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
there's a slight difference between

885
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
outcomes and outputs

886
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,640
so outcomes against more general about

887
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
okay you have achieved the following

888
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
and outputs other great documents

889
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,040
information items and and things like

890
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,359
that so it's a lot more detailed and

891
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,440
like in specification or an interface

892
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,599
document or or whatsoever you know so

893
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,440
this is but this is not covered by by

894
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,199
1528 there it is more general okay

895
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,320
okay

896
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,359
so and if uh 15 to 88 and the incosi

897
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,239
handbook is aligned uh is there also an

898
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,560
alignment between 5288 and the new

899
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
incosivision 2035

900
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,320
body cozy version 2035 is is very much

901
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,918
future looking you know so therefore

902
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,359
like what i said before 15 to 88 is

903
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,280
the state of the practice yeah which

904
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,399
means that

905
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,399
the iso standard is something like

906
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,760
uh let me say 10 years behind the

907
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
division document which is very much

908
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
future looking and explaining i say what

909
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560
approach is necessary in order to

910
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
achieve this this vision or at least to

911
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,640
come close to it yeah probably cannot

912
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,000
fully achieve it

913
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,640
but what's uh what needs to be done

914
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
but really where all the things come

915
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
together is so to say that the

916
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,280
incosivision also promotes a picture

917
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,680
that we have to slightly change our

918
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,000
approach to systems engineering and such

919
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
and in particular on the in the way how

920
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,119
we educate our people uh in order that

921
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,400
they become um say they become more

922
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
fit for their work so to say yeah when

923
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
they apply systems engineering and they

924
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
of course then there's a big overlap to

925
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,280
15 to 88 because they will be working in

926
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,920
this environment and with 15 28

927
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,920
processes

928
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,680
so

929
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,400
i would say that was

930
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
much information

931
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
and

932
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
even stephan haute mentioned he again

933
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,359
