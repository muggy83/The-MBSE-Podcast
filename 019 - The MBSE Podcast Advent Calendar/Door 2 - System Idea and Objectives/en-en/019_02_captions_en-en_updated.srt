00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,393
Hello, behind the 2nd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:07,780
We describe the System Idea
and the System Goals

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,939
The System Idea is the elevator pitch
of the system of interest

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,978
It briefly and crisply describes
what a system is

5
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:17,889
with special focus on
what makes it special

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,630
It is a text and provided
the graphics if needed

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,780
Let's look at it in the model

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,030
The SysML language does not know
the concept of System Idea

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,510
Interesting, SysML does not know
the concept of System either

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,380
although it's a systems modeling language

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,779
You can teach the language new concepts

12
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:46,689
We have the profiles
and stereotypes about this

13
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,676
Behind what are the following doors

14
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,723
there will be the exposit
explanation about this as well

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,399
Here in a nutshell, SYSMOD introduces
the concept of a system by a stereotype

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,869
specialized from the block

17
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,929
And you can define the System
Idea as a property of it

18
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:08,390
In the model, it can then
be represented like this

19
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,520
It is a too specific property
that the texts can be formatted

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,830
If graphics are a part of
the System Idea, they are all friends

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,019
The System Idea of
the Christmas tree is as follows

22
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,159
"The Christmas tree is the symbolic
centre of the Christmas celebration"

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,950
and delights people
especially children

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,980
"The Christmas tree branches prevent
evil spirits from entering the house

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,810
and give hope for the next spring"

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,920
The System Objectives are also a concept
that SysML does not recognize

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,710
SYSMOD again uses the stereotype
to include it to the language

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,054
The System Objective is a special
form of a SysML Requirement

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,179
The following requirements diagram shows
the objectives of our Christmas tree

30
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:59,240
We have an upper-level
summarizing objective "OBJ0"

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,880
which summarizes all the
"MBSE Christmas Tree Objectives"

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,610
And we have different objectives like
having the "Best Christmas Tree"

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,658
the "Number of Gifts"
"Zero Footprint" on the environment

34
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:21,365
and we all trace it back
to the "MBSE Podcast"

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,660
The diagram topology of the
elements doesn't include much yet

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,680
So, it is a good practice instead to
manage the model information in tables

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,540
In this stage a lot of modeling efforts

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,380
In addition, today's modeling tools'
tables are usually more furious

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,370
that means they show all
elements in the model

40
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,680
In the diagram

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,450
there are only the elements that
a modeler has placed manually on it

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,260
If needed, the diagram can be created
quickly easily for a workshop

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,400
You may have noticed the stakeholder

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,450
System Objectives just have a
relationship to the stakeholders

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,279
who are responsible for the goal

46
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:08,316
Here, it is the Podcast hosts
Christian and me

47
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:12,325
And as we are responsible for
the overall of the system

48
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:16,833
SysML knows the concept of a stakeholder

49
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:21,780
And SYSMOD never the less defines
the stereotype "extendedStakeholder"

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,150
to extend special properties like
a contract or a priority

51
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,830
Since the stakeholders are also
related to the requirements

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,519
they are also belong there

53
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,198
They are stored in the
requirement package in the model

54
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:42,440
You could represent them in the diagram
as much more practical tabular form

55
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,210
The table does not show all properties
of the stakeholders in this case

56
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:54,190
but only the name, documentation
the contact information, and a priority

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,327
So much for the 2nd door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

58
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,683
And we wish you a great 2nd of December

59
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:03,997
Goodbye

60
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:05,630
Bye-bye
