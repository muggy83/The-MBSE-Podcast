00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to the 17th door of our mdse

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,080
podcast advent calendar today we take a

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
look at the modeling of parametric

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
the parametric diagram depicts a network

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,360
of constraints that constrain properties

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,799
of the system

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,039
if your modeling tool is able to execute

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,279
the parametrics it could be an extremely

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
effective modeling approach

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,080
so let's have a look at it in our model

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
first we need the expressions which are

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,599
defined by constraint blocks the lower

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,760
constraint block specifies a min max

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
expression using three parameters min

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
value max value and value

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
which are each typed by our value type

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,719
centimeter

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
the constraint block trunk stand

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
connection constraint verifies that the

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
trunk fits into the stand it does not

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
define a constraint but owns a

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
constraint property typed by our min max

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,559
constraint block

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
the parametric diagram is a special kind

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
of an internal block diagram which

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
depicts how parameters of the

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
constraints are connected with other

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
parameters or value properties

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
the parametric diagram shows the

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
internal structure of the trunks then

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
connect to constraint

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
which simply connects its parameters

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
with the appropriate internal constraint

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
parameters of the min max constraint

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
block

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
we defined a constraint property of type

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
trunk stand connection constraint owned

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
by our system to use this constraint for

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
the mbse podcast christmas tree

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,479
in a parametric diagram of the tmpct

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,159
base architecture

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,759
we connect the parameters of the

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,920
constraint with the appropriate value

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
properties of the system the very

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
properties already have defined default

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
values however they could be redefined

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
later by the specialized properties in

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,040
the physical architecture

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,920
we also added another interesting

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
constraint property

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
which is the constraint block height of

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
the tree

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
which is a constraint block and a

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
requirement at the same time

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
since sysml 1.5 any named model element

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,200
can also be a requirement

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
the requirement and constraint block

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
height of the tree requires and verifies

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
that the height of the tree is between

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,800
150 and 200 centimeters

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,599
the parametric diagram of the system

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
element the mbse podcast christmas tree

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,400
shows how everything is connected

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,319
our modeling tool can also run the

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,319
constraints

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,120
when we instantiate our tmpct system

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
element we see in the output that

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
constraints are satisfied

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
the tool then displays the corresponding

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
area in green

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
so much for the 17th tour of our mbse

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
a great 17th of december

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
goodbye

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
bye
