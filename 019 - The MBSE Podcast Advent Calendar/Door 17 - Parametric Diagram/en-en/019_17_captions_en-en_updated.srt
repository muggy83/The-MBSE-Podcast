00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,210
Welcome to the 17th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,640
Today we take a look at the
modeling of parametric

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,060
The parametric diagram depicts
a network of constraints

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,799
that constrain properties of the system

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,454
If your modeling tool is able
to execute the parametrics

6
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:21,540
it could be an extremely
effective modeling approach

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,690
So, let's have a look at it in our model

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,730
First, we need the expressions
which are defined by constraint blocks

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,050
The lower constraint block specifies a
min max expression using three parameters

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,120
"minValue", "maxValue", and "value"

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,470
which are each typed by
our value type "Centimeter"

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,970
The constraint block
"TrunkStandConnectionConstraint"

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,597
verifies that the trunk
fits into the stand

14
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:52,739
It does not define a constraint
but owns a constraint property

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,199
typed by our min max constraint block

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,693
The parametric diagram is a special
kind of an internal block diagram

17
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,420
which depicts how parameters
of the constraints

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,962
are connected with other
parameters or value properties

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
The parametric diagram shows
the internal structure of the "Trunk"

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
then connect to constraint

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
which simply connects its parameters

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,468
with the appropriate internal
constraint parameters

23
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:21,290
of the min max constraint block

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
We defined a constraint property of type

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,804
"TrunkStandConnectionConstraint"

26
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:32,210
owned by our system to use this constraint
for the MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,159
In a parametric diagram of
the TMPCT Base Architecture

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,812
we connect the parameters
of the constraint

29
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:43,299
with the appropriate
value properties of the system

30
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,107
The value properties already
have defined default values

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,185
however they could be redefined later

32
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:53,139
by the specialized properties
in the Physical Architecture

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,520
We also added another
interesting constraint property

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
which is the constraint block
"Height of The Tree"

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
which is a constraint block and
a requirement at the same time

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,839
since SysML1.5, any named model
element can also be a requirement

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,901
The requirement and constraint
block "Height of The Tree"

38
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,560
requires and verifies that
the height of the tree

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,060
is between 150 and 200 centimeters

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,340
The parametric diagram
of the system element

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,740
the MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree
shows how everything is connected

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,919
Our modeling tool can also
run the constraints

43
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,558
When we instantiate our
TMPCT system element

44
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:43,840
we see in the output that
constraints are satisfied

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,430
The tool then displays the
corresponding area in green

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,610
So much for the 17th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,850
And we wish you a great 17th of December

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,050
Goodbye

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,039
Bye-bye
