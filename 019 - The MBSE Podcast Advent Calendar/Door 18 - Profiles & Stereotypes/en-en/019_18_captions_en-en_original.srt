00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,679
welcome to the 18th store of our mbse

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,480
podcast advent calendar today we take a

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
look at the modeling of profiles and

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,960
stereotypes

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,880
typically you cannot use sml out of the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
box very well the language is too

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
general to provide enough words to talk

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,600
about a corporate system for example

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
systematic finds a block but not a

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
system subsystem component module domain

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
block software block and so forth

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
or sociality finds a requirement with

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,480
only three properties name id and text

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,800
but neither functional requirements nor

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
performance requirements nor properties

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,879
like a priority motivation or risks

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120
it is intended that you extend susml

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
with a more specific vocabulary that

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
fits your need

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,039
so let's have a look at how we did it in

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
our model

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
besides others our model applies to

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
sysmod profile a profile defines an

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
extension of sysml

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,760
the profile application relationships

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
make the extension available for the

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
model

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
the profile is similar to a package and

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
contains stereotypes a stereotype

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,720
extends an existing system element it

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,439
provides a name and semantic and can

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
provide additional properties and

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
quotations

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
the following diagram shows some

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
stereotypes of the system profile which

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,880
extends the sysml block

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
the system stereotype specializes with

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
the smart block

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
and adds two properties to store the

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
problem statement and the system idea of

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
the system

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,240
the cismod stereotypes are defining also

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
different actor categories

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
like external systems environmental

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
effects and so on

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,520
as well as it introduces a new notation

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
therefore the actor can be depicted by

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
cubes in the system context

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
typically the first step before modeling

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
stereotypes is creating a concept model

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
of the new concepts

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
as one example this block definition

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
diagram shows the concept of variant

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
modeling terms from the vamos profile

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
vamos stands for variant modeling with

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
susaml

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,440
the wellness stereotypes which are part

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
of the system profile are derived from

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,000
this concept model

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,520
we will have a more detailed look at

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
variant modeling tomorrow

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
so much for the 18th store of our nbc

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
a great 18th of december bye bye

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
goodbye
