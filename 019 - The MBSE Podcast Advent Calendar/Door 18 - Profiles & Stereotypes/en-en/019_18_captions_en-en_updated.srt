Welcome to the 18th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:10,600
Today we take a look at the modeling
of profiles and stereotypes

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,660
Typically you cannot use SysML
out of the box very well

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,610
The language is too general
to provide enough words

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,800
to talk about a complex system

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,480
For example, SysML defines a block

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,629
but not "system", "subsystem"

8
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:29,039
"component", "module", "domainBlock"
"softwareBlock, and so forth

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,948
Or SysML defines a requirement
with only three properties

10
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,480
"name", "id", and "text"

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,220
But neither "functional requirements"
nor "performance requirements"

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,569
nor "properties" like a "priority"
"motivation", or "risks"

13
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,271
It is intended that you extend SysML

14
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,400
with a more specific vocabulary
that fits your need

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,169
so, let's have a look at
how we did it in our model

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,286
Besides others, our model
applies to SYSMOD profile

17
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,879
a profile defines an
extension of SysML

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,107
The profile application relationships

19
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:07,143
make the extension
available for the model

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,120
The profile is similar to a package
and contains stereotypes

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,470
A stereotype extends an
existing SysML element

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,190
It provides a name and semantic

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,830
and can provide additional
properties and quotations

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,864
The following diagram shows some
stereotypes of the SYSMOD profile

25
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:28,580
which extends the SysML block

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
The system stereotype
specializes the SysML block

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
and adds two properties

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,020
to store the "Problem Statement"
and the "System Idea" of the system

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,240
The SYSMOD stereotypes are
defining also different actor categories

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,479
like "External Systems"
"Environmental Effects", and so on

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,520
as well as it introduces a new notation

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Therefore, the actor can be depicted
by cubes in the system context

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,538
Typically the first step
before modeling stereotypes

34
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:07,619
is creating a concept model
of the new concepts

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,420
As one example

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,040
this block definition diagram shows
the concept of variant modeling terms

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,680
from the VAMOS profile

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,749
VAMOS stands for Variant
Modeling with SysML

39
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,579
The VAMOS stereotypes which are
part of the SYSMOD profile

40
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,720
are derived from this concept model

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,270
We will have a more detailed look
at variant modeling tomorrow

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,730
So much for the 18th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,420
And we wish you a great 18th of December

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,510
Bye-bye

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,890
Goodbye
