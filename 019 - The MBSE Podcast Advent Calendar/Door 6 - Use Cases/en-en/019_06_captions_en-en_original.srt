00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,280
welcome behind the six store of our mbse

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
podcast advent calendar we take a look

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
at the system use cases

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
there are a lot of methods for modeling

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,240
use cases published in many books papers

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
and other publications

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,880
we present a very simple method and

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
avoid use case relationships such as

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,039
include extend or generalization between

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
the use cases

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,599
the use cases here are simply a list of

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,760
the functions of the system in which

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
actors are involved and which create

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,960
value for an actor or stakeholder

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
so let's have a look in the model

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
some of our use cases of the mbse

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,840
podcast christmas tree are depicted in

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
the use case diagram with the associated

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
actors

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
there are a few special features in the

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,600
modeling

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,399
the actor carrier of the use case

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,079
transport christmas tree is a

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
generalization of the actor's christmas

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
tree seller and owner

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
it is an xor condition so the use case

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,760
has only one actor which could be either

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
the seller or an owner

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
the association end at the child actor

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
has a multiplicity zero to many

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
which means that children are optional

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
but they could be

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
there could be many of them

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
who are enjoying the christmas tree

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
although use case diagrams are very

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,920
common

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
they just show more or less only a

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
graphical list of use cases you can

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
depict the same information in a table

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,640
plus more properties

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,799
the table shows also documentation of

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
the use case as well as additional

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,479
properties introduced by the sysmod

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,119
stereotype system use case

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
for the trigger and the result of the

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
use case

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
the trigger signal property stores a

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,719
signal to formalize the trigger when the

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,640
use case is executed

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,159
you will meet it again when we talk

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,320
about state machines

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
and that's the learning surprise behind

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,280
the store tables are valid use of system

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
model elements and they can be much more

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,239
convenient than a diagram

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,879
you do not have the layout effort and

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
depending on the tool tables are

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
typically queries and always up to date

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
use the tables for the daily engineering

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
work and diagrams for workshops

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
presentations or eventually documents

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
so much for the sixth door of the mbse

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
podcast advent calendar

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
we wish you a great 6th of december

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
goodbye
