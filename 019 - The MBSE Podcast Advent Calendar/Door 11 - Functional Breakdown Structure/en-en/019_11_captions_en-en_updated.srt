Welcome to our MBSE
Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,250
Behind the 11th door, we take again
look at the Functional Architecture

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,670
Yesterday we created Functional Groups

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,089
And today we look on the derivation

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,710
of the first version of
the Functional Architecture

6
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:22,676
And here comes the special
learning gift of this advent calendar

7
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:25,170
This step and other steps
of the FAS method

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,960
could be done automatically or assisted

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,060
by the FAS plugin for Magic Draw

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,178
that is provided by the German
chapter of INCOSE (GfSE)

11
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:37,790
You can download the plugin
for free from SourceForge

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,205
at https://sourceforge.net
/projects/fas4md/

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,549
The Functional Groups are
in the sub-packages

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,004
of Functional Architecture package

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,859
And for each Functional Group
we created a functional block

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,991
and model a trace relationship
between them

17
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,630
The functional block is also
a stereotype specializing the block

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,500
from the FAS profile

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,290
The relationships can again be
depicted in the matrix

20
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:13,440
In the matrix, you can easily see
all the functional blocks

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,660
have exactly one relation
to one Functional Group

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,770
We created the root functional block

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,349
that represents the whole
Functional Architecture

24
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,780
and created the composition structure

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,350
as depicted in the
following definition diagram

26
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:34,248
The more interesting part of
the Functional Architecture

27
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:38,908
is depicted in the internal block diagram
that we will see tomorrow

28
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,667
So much for the 11th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

29
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,247
And we wish you a great 11th of December

30
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,247
Good bye

31
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,296
Good bye
