00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome to the 16th store of our mbse

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,879
podcast advent calendar today we take a

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,080
look at modeling of a sequence diagram

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,400
a sequence diagram depicts the exchange

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
of messages between properties

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,080
represented by the so-called lifelines

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,600
let's look at it in our model

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,039
our sequence diagram shows a simple

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
scenario of our mbse podcast christmas

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
tree actually the tree does not include

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,280
so many scenarios but it's just a tree

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
the model element represented by the

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
whole sequence diagram is called an

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
interaction here the interaction is

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
owned by the system context element

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
the user sends a switch on signal to the

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,600
enjoyment control unit it is an

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
asynchronous message

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,079
then

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,920
the internal operation start flashing

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
program is called which starts a loop to

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,719
switch on and off the fairy lights and

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
in parallel the lights enjoy a child

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
you can use sequence diagrams for

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,119
several purposes for example specify a

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
test case specify a communication

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
protocol demonstrate an example and so

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
forth

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
so much for the 16th store of our nbc

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
podcast i'm red calendar and we wish you

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,360
a great 16th of december

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,320
goodbye bye
