00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,290
Welcome to the 16th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,839
Today we take a look at
modeling of a sequence diagram

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
A sequence diagram depicts the exchange
of messages between properties

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,790
represented by the so-called lifelines

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,300
Let's look at it in our model

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,623
Our sequence diagram shows
a simple scenario

7
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:28,474
of our MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

8
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:31,848
Actually the tree does not
include so many scenarios

9
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:35,010
but it's just a tree

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,371
The model element represented
by the whole sequence diagram

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,612
is called an interaction

12
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:44,439
Here the interaction is owned
by the system context element

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,898
The user sends a "SwitchOn" signal to
the "Enjoyment Control Unit"

14
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,199
It is an asynchronous message

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,554
Then the internal operation
"startFlashingProgram"

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,719
is called which starts a loop
to switch on and off the "Fairy Lights"

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,620
And in parallel, the lights enjoy a child

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,603
You can use sequence diagrams
for several purposes

19
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:09,944
For example, specify a test case
specify a communication protocol

20
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,820
demonstrate an example and so forth

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,940
So much for the 16th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,392
And we wish you a great 16th of December

23
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:22,310
Goodbye

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,250
Bye-bye
