00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,178
Welcome to the 21st door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:09,289
Today we take a look at
the death of the actors

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,238
That doesn't sound very Christmassy

4
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,679
But we definitely need to talk about it

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,720
The actors died a long time ago

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,760
Curious?

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,350
Let's have a look in our model

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,744
Our system context diagram
clearly shows actors

9
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,456
So, who is that here?

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,565
Therefore, we need to distinguish

11
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:33,520
between the concept actor
from the SysML element actor

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,530
The model element is that
or rather we bury it

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
Why?

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Let's take a closer look

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
So, the concept of actor is great

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,779
External entities interacting
with the system and so on

17
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:51,410
with all the methodological
variants that exist

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,360
The SysML model element
actor is problematic

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,293
It comes from UML and is
there defined in such a way

20
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,879
that an actor may not have

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,890
any ports, receptions, operations
attributes, or parts

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,264
But these features are
needed now and then

23
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:11,454
For example, our actor
"power Supply" has a port

24
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:16,270
or our actor "room" has
a part named "floor"

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,400
So if we just claimed that a SysML actor
can't have that why could we model that

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
Well

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
Because we did not use the SysML
actor as mentioned at the beginning

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
The actor is dead respectively
non-existent for us

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,630
Formally our actor kinds
from the SYSMOD profile

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,119
are stereotypes specializing
the SysML block

31
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,260
So, the stereotypes define the
appropriate actor semantics

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,139
By the way, this is not a
nasty work around

33
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,200
but formally mapped correctly

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,943
even the SysML specification uses
this kind of actor modeling

35
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:57,699
in its hybrid SUV model

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,822
Thus actors have the
same capability as block

37
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:06,090
and can have ports, internal
structures, and so on

38
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,743
So, we have by no means trash
the concept of the actor

39
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,840
but the SysML model element

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,450
The actor is dead
long live the actor

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
So much for the 21st door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,219
And we wish you a great 21st of December

43
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,219
Bye-bye

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,039
Goodbye
