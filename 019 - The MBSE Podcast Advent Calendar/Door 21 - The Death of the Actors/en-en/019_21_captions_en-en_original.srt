00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,679
welcome to the 21st store of our embassy

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,319
podcast advent calendar today we take a

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,519
look at the death of the actors

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,280
that doesn't sound very christmassy but

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,679
we definitely need to talk about it

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
the actors died a long time ago curious

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
let's have a look in our model

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,600
our system context diagram clearly shows

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,920
actors so who is that here

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
therefore we need to distinguish between

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,159
the concept actor from the system l

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,520
element actor

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,160
the model element is that or rather we

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
bury it

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
why

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
let's take a closer look

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
so the concept of actor is great

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
external entities interacting with the

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,120
system and so on with all the

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
methodological variants that exist

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
the sosumel model element actor is

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
problematic

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
it comes from uml and is there defined

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
in such a way that an actor may not have

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,760
acne parts receptions operations

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,240
attributes or parts

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
but these features are needed now and

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,640
then for example our actual power supply

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,240
has a port or our actual room has a part

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,799
named floor

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
so if we just claimed that a small actor

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,840
can't have that why could we model that

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
well

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
because we did not use the system

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
electro as mentioned at the beginning

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
the actor is dead respectively

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,240
non-existent for us

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
formally our actor kinds from the sisma

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
profile are stereotypes specializing

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,119
this isn't a block

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
so the stereotypes define the

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720
appropriate actor semantics

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,479
by the way this is not a nasty work

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,200
around but formally mapped correctly

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
even the ssml specification uses this

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,079
kind of acta modeling in its hybrid suv

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,920
model

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,399
thus actors have the same capability

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,880
cities as blocks and can have ports

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
internal structures and so on

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,639
so we have by no means trash the concept

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,800
of the actor but the sesame model

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,840
element

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
the actor is dead

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
long live the actor

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
so much for the 21st door of our embassy

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,879
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,239
a great 21st of december bye-bye goodbye
