00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,679
ho ho ho

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,399
behind the 12th door of our mbse podcast

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,800
advent calendar we take a final look at

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,599
the functional architecture

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,599
yesterday we created the breakdown

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,639
structure of the functional architecture

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,240
now we look at the interesting part of

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
the functional architecture it is the

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,240
internal structure with ports and

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,920
connections between the functional parts

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
it is also of interest to consider the

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,840
functional system context therefore we

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
inherit the function called text from

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
the system context

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
the inherited actors are not purely

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
functional but our normal system actors

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
an internal block diagram of the

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,079
functional context elements

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,559
shows the context and the structure of

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,120
the functional

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
architecture functional path represents

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
a group of activities

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,959
and the connectors and parts are derived

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,119
from the activity models

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
if an activity of one part

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
has an output parameter which is an

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
input parameter of an activity in

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
another function part

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
they are connected and the port

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,320
specifies that these parameter objects

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
flow through it

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
some parts have no arrow inside the

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
rectangle symbol

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
here the detailed specification of the

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,119
flow property is missing because either

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,280
it's not important or it has not been

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,920
modeled yet

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
the flow properties are specified by

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
interface blocks

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
the interface blocks are the types of

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,880
the ports

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
the block definition diagram shows some

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
of our functional interface books

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,600
so much for the 12th door of our mbse

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
a great 12th of december

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
bye-bye

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
goodbye
