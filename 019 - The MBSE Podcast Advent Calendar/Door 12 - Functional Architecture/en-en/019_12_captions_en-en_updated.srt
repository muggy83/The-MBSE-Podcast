00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,679
Ho ho ho!

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,268
Behind the 12th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:11,599
We take a final look at
the Functional Architecture

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,249
Yesterday we created the breakdown
structure of the Functional Architecture

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,855
Now we look at the interesting
part of the Functional Architecture

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,240
It is the internal structure with ports

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,890
and connections between
the functional parts

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,571
It is also of interest to consider
the functional system context

9
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:39,920
therefore we inherit the function
called text from the system context

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,688
The inherited actors are
not purely functional

11
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:46,150
but our normal system actors

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,079
An internal block diagram of
the functional context elements

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,109
shows the context and the structure
of the Functional Architecture

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,760
A functional path represents
a group of activities

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,119
and the connectors and parts are
derived from the activity models

16
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,283
If an activity of one part has
an output parameter

17
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:15,360
which is an input parameter of
an activity in another function part

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
They are connected and the port

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,610
specifies that these parameter
objects flow through it

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
Some parts have no arrow
inside the rectangle symbol

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,064
Here the detailed specification
of the flow property is missing

22
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:35,359
because either it's not important or
it has not been modeled yet

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
The flow properties are
specified by interface blocks

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
The interface blocks are
the types of the ports

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,370
the block definition diagram shows
some of our functional interface books

26
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,901
So much for the 12th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

27
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:00,870
And we wish you a great 12th of December

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,920
Bye-bye

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,800
Goodbye
