00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,360
welcome to the mbse podcast advent

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,480
calendar

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
we will open a new door every day until

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
december 24th this means that every day

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
there will be a short mbse podcast

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
episode

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
in 25 episodes we will each briefly

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
describe how to model a system using the

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
system methodology each episode

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
highlights a new aspect the system is

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,439
our super cool mbse podcast christmas

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,039
tree

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
of course the example is not entirely

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,400
serious

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
but we are modeling seriously

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
sometimes this will make

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
it look a little bit strange but

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
certainly very much like over modeling

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
with our advent calendar you get a

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,399
lightweight overview of modeling a

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
system and the essential steps of the

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,879
mbse methodology sysmod in addition each

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
episode also contains a small gift in

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
the form of a good practice

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
the advent calendar episodes are a

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,840
little bit differently to our previous

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,239
episodes they are only about five

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,120
minutes long and we don't have guests

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,000
and

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
since we are showing how to model the

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
audio only channel only works to a

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
limited extent

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
and we use the camille systems modeler

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
and the sysmod profile as our systems

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,759
modeling environment for the project

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,680
however any other system compliant

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
morning tool could also be used for the

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
project

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
in 2022 we will continue with our

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,479
regular

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
mbse podcast episodes with live sessions

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
and exciting guests from the mbse

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
community

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
okay so now let's take a first look at

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,640
our model

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,399
on the left side of the model you can

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920
see the model structure

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
the package derived properties is too

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
specific and we will not have any

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,960
further look on this one

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
the international christmas tree

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
standard is a model library covered in

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
the following sessions about

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
requirements

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
and the package symbol with the tiny

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
triangle is the root of our product

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,318
model the mbse podcast christmas tree or

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,040
abbreviated tm pct

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
and on the next level you can see

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
packages for several engineering

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
artifacts like the context, requirements

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
or the architectures they will be

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
covered step by step in the following

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
episodes

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
and here comes our special learning gift

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
of this episode

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
it is a good practice to design the

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,640
package structure the following way at

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
the top level separation is made

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,239
according to primary engineering

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
artifacts the package names are each

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,360
given the namespace above as a prefix

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,879
for example t and pct underscore context

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,519
at the base architecture or physical

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,840
architecture level below the elements of

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
individual components of the system such

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,440
as the tree itself are stored in their

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
own packages

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
their substructure behaves like the

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
structure of the system model thus the

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
package structure scales very well

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
if required these packages can be cut

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
out and used as separate system models

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
now let's open the package diagram tmpct

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
model structure it depicts the applied

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
profiles

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
and used libraries of our system model

88
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,959
as you can see from left to right we

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
applied the sysmod profile to use sysmod

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
specific model elements like

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
system system context or system use

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
cases

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
we also applied the fast profile for

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
modeling the functional architecture

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,159
using the first method and we imported

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
engineering for planet model library for

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
sustainability elements

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
that library is provided also by sysmod

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
we import the passcatalog model library

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
to get some nice reusable elements the

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
library is also provided by the smart

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,519
and we import the international

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
christmas standard model library to get

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,799
common christmas tree requirements

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,720
all the profiles and libraries will be

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
used in some of the following sessions

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
as well as will be explicitly covered

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,159
by

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
other episodes about profiles and model

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
libraries

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
so much for the first tour of our mbse

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
podcast advanced calendar and we wish

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
you a great first of december

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
goodbye
