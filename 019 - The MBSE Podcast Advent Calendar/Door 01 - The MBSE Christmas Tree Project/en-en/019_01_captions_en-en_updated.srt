00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome to the MBSE Podcast
Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,094
We will open a new door every day
until December 24th

3
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:13,120
This means that every day there will be
a short MBSE Podcast episode

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,280
In 25 episodes we will
each briefly describe

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,950
how to model a system
using the SYSMOD methodology

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,544
Each episode highlights a new aspect

7
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:26,804
the system is our super cool
MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
Of course, the example is
not entirely serious

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
but we are modeling seriously

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
Sometimes this will make

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,702
it look a little bit strange

12
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,740
but certainly very much like over modeling

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,499
With our Advent Calendar

14
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,929
you get a lightweight overview
of modeling a system

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,142
and the essential steps of
the MBSE methodology SYSMOD

16
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:51,260
In addition, each episode
also contains a small gift

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,408
in the form of a good practice

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,589
The Advent Calendar episodes are a little
bit differently to our previous episodes

19
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:01,037
they are only about five minutes long

20
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,120
and we don't have guests

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,448
And since we are showing how to model

22
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,460
the audio only channel only
works to a limited extent

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
And we use the Cameo Systems Modeler

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,759
and the SYSMOD profile as our systems
modeling environment for the project

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,882
However any other SysML compliant morning
tool could also be used for the project

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,360
In 2022 we will continue with our regular
MBSE Podcast episodes with live sessions

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,270
and exciting guests from
the MBSE community

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,420
Okay so now
Let's take a first look at our model

29
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,705
On the left side of the model
you can see the model structure

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,274
The package Derived Properties
is too specific

31
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:54,960
and we will not have any further
look on this one

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,920
The International Christmas
Tree Standard is a model library

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,190
covered in the following sessions
about requirements

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,944
And the package symbol with the tiny
triangle is the root of our product model

35
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:13,040
The MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree
or abbreviated TMPCT

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,760
And on the next level, you can see
packages for several engineering artifacts

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,726
like the context, requirements
or the architectures

38
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:24,076
They will be covered step by step
in the following episodes

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,320
And here comes our special
learning gift of this episode

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
It is a good practice to design the
package structure the following way

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,107
At the top level separation is made
according to primary engineering artifacts

42
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:41,360
The package names are each given
the namespace above as a prefix

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,879
For example, "TMPCT_Context"

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,775
At the base architecture or
physical architecture level below

45
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:54,117
the elements of individual
components of the system

46
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:58,800
such as the Tree itself are stored
in their own packages

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,440
Their substructure behaves like
the structure of the system model

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,680
Thus the package structure
scales very well

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,057
if required these packages can be cut out
and used as separate system models

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,371
Now, let's open the package
diagram TMPCT model structure

51
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:21,863
It depicts the applied profiles
and used libraries of our system model

52
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,563
As you can see from left to right

53
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:29,019
we applied the SYSMOD profile to use
SYSMOD specific model elements

54
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,680
like System, System Context,
or System Use Cases

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,708
we also applied the FAS profile
for modeling the functional architecture

56
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,118
using the FAS method

57
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:44,560
And we imported Engineering4Planet
model library for sustainability elements

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,710
That library is provided also by SYSMOD

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,020
We import the PartsCatalogue model library
to get some nice reusable elements

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,000
The library is also provided
by the SYSMOD

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,679
And we import the International
Christmas Standard model library

62
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,679
to get common Christmas tree requirements

63
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
All the profiles and libraries will be
used in some of the following sessions

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,118
as well as will be explicitly
covered by other episodes

65
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,721
about profiles and model libraries

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,034
So, much for the first tour of our
MBSE Podcast Advanced Calendar

67
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:22,022
And we wish you a great first of December

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,970
Goodbye
