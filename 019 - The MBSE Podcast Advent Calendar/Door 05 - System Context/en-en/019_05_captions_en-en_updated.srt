Hello

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,612
Behind the 5th door of our MBSE
Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,750
we take a look at the System Context

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,699
We already defined a context
for the Base Architecture

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,639
behind door number 4
our advent calendar

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,600
The Base Architecture Context constrains
the context of our system of interest

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,490
We model it by defining
a generalization relationship

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,820
from the System Context to
the Base Architecture Context

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,099
Let's check that out in the model

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,482
You can see that the part property
the "MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree"

11
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:39,600
is a redefinition of the inherited
system based property

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,350
Base TMPCT from
the Base Architecture Context

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,781
In addition to the inherited actors from
the Base Architecture Context

14
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:56,629
the "TMPCT System Context" has an
additional actor "Christmas Tree Seller"

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,330
The System Context elements
are SysML blocks

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,760
with applied stereotype "systemContext"
from the SYSMOD profile

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,609
It is just a marker profile

18
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:14,040
that introduces a new name and additional
semantics but no new properties

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,030
The internal block diagram of
the System Context element

20
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,720
depicts the well-known
system context diagram

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,494
The inherited elements from the
Base Architecture Contexts

22
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:33,119
have a circumflex prefix symbol
this little roof before the name

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,880
and in our System Context all actors
are inherited except the "seller"

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,359
like Tim explained before

25
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,735
SysML provides only the
general concept of an actor

26
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,200
it is useful to define
different actor kinds

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
to emphasize the different
methodological approaches

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
At least you should differentiate
between humans and non-humans

29
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
In the shown context diagram
you can see four different actor kinds

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
human users for the system
for example, the "santa Claus"

31
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,478
external systems for example
the "power Supply"

32
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,403
a mechanical system is a special
kind of an external system

33
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:11,458
that has only mechanical
interactions with the system here

34
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,319
It is the "floor" of our "room"

35
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,529
And the "planet Environment" to consider
the impact of the system on the planet

36
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
All actors have some kind of
interaction with the system

37
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,680
And you could specify
the interaction point by ports

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
And here, we have the little
surprising learning in this episode

39
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,000
Stakeholders are not in the context or
only when they interact with the system

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
For example

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,280
We MBSE Podcast hosts are
stakeholders of the system

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,046
But we are not actors

43
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:53,327
of course as people we could take on
the role of user of the Christmas tree

44
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:57,280
But the MBSE Podcast
host role is not an actor

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,670
and thus the system does not provide any
special interfaces or functions for us

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
Vice versa, all actors are
stakeholders of the system

47
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
Sometimes they are not directly
stakeholders but representatives

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,369
For example, things like the
"floor" are not a stakeholder

49
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,739
But the owner of the "floor"
is the stakeholder

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,330
So much for the 5th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

51
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,290
We wish you a great 5th of December

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
Goodbye

53
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,749
Bye-bye
