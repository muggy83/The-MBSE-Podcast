00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,240
hello

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,319
behind the fifth door of our mbse

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,720
podcast advent calendar we take a look

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,960
at the system context

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
we already defined a context for the

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,639
base architecture behind door number

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,639
four or advent calendar

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,039
the base architecture context constrains

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,600
the context of our system of interest

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
we model it by defining a generalization

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
relationship from the system context to

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the base architecture context let's

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,119
check that out in the model

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
you can see that the part property the

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,160
mbse podcast christmas tree is a

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
redefinition of the inherited system

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
based property

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,360
base

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,800
tmpct from the base architecture context

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
in addition to the inherited actors from

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
the base architecture context the tmpct

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
system context has an additional actor

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,879
christmas tree seller

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
the system context elements are sml

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
blocks with applied stereotype system

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,760
context from the sysmod profile

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,080
it is just a marker profile that

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
introduces a new name and additional

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
semantics but no new properties

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,560
the internal block diagram of the system

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
context element depicts the well-known

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
system context diagram

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
the inherited elements from the base

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,960
architecture contexts have a circumflex

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
prefix symbol this little roof before

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,119
the name

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,240
and in our system context all actors are

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
inherited except the seller

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
like tim explained before

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
this map provides only the general

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
concept of an actor it is useful to

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
define different actor kinds to

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
emphasize the different methodological

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
approaches at least you should

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,280
differentiate between humans and

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,399
non-humans

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,920
in the show and context diagram you can

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
see four different actor kinds

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
human users for the system for example

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,079
center class

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
external systems for example the power

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
supply a mechanical system is a special

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,878
kind of an external system that has only

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
mechanical interactions with the system

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
here it is the floor of our room

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
and the planet environment to consider

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
the impact of the system on the planet

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
all actors have some kind of interaction

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
with the system

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
and you could specify the interaction

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,040
point by ports

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
and here we have the little surprising

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
learning in this episode

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,680
stakeholders are not in the context or

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
only when they interact with the system

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
for example

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
we

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
mbse podcast hosts are stakeholders of

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
the system

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,080
but we are not actors of course as

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
people we could take on the role of user

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
of the christmas tree but the mbse

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
podcast host role is not an actor and

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
thus the system does not provide any

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
special interfaces or functions for us

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
vice versa all actors are stakeholders

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,599
of the system

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,120
sometimes they are not directly

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,760
stakeholders but representatives

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
for example things like the floor are

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
not a stakeholder but the owner of the

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,599
floor is the stakeholder

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
so much for the fifth door of our mbse

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
podcast advent calendar we wish you a

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
great 5th of december

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,599
goodbye

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,599
bye
