Welcome to the 20th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,470
Today we take a look at non-SysML views

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,515
SysML defines nine different diagram types

4
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:15,920
such as the use case diagram, the
block definition diagram, and so on

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,119
Additionally tables and matrix
views are defined

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
Other views are perfectly possible even
if they are not covered by the standards

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,460
So, let's have a look at some of them

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,299
The relationship map diagram is a special
diagram of the Cameo Systems Modeler

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,200
Starting from one element, a tree
is spent on defined relationships

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,838
In this example, all elements are in
the namespace of the previous node

11
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,267
which is shown

12
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:47,820
It shows all use cases and
the selected package

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,790
and then all contained
use case activities

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,881
The classic is, of course, Excel

15
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,955
Some modeling tools offer
it directly out of the box

16
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,960
to export model elements to Excel

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,980
Some can also make the return trip and
import Excel data back into the model

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,260
Needless to say that you can also
generate text documents from a model

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,190
The text document is another
special view of our model

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,561
Other interesting views
are dynamic diagrams

21
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,200
such as those offered by
the graph database Neo4j

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
The Syndeia tool from Intercax can
export the SysML models to Neo4j

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,844
There the model can then be viewed
in the dynamic graph diagrams

24
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:35,200
For example, to identify patterns
and derive insights

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,118

So much for the 20th door
of our MBSE Podcast

29
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
And we wish you a great 20th of December

30
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,028
Bye-bye
