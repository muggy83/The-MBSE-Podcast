00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,960
welcome to the 20th store of our mbse

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,880
podcast advent calendar

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,120
today we take a look at non-systeml

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,720
views

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
systemrt defines nine different diagram

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
types such as the use case diagram the

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,920
block definition diagram and so on

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
additionally tables and matrix views are

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,119
defined

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
other views are perfectly possible even

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
if they are not covered by the standards

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
so let's have a look at some of them

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,679
the relationship map diagram is a

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,439
special diagram of the coming of systems

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,399
modeler starting from one element a tree

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
is spent on defined relationships in

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
this example all elements are in the

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
namespace of the previous node which is

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,160
shown it shows all use cases and the

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
selected package and then all contained

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
use case activities

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,280
the classic is of course excel some

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
modeling tools offer it directly out of

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,840
the box to export model elements to

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
excel

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
some can also make the return trip and

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
import excel data back into the model

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
needless to say that you can also

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
generate text documents from a model the

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
text document is another special view of

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
our model

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
other interesting views are dynamic

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
diagrams such as those offered by the

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
graph database neo4j

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
the cinder tool from intercax can export

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
the small models to neo4j

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
there the model can then be viewed in

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,240
the dynamic graph diagrams for example

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,200
to identify patterns and derive insights

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
so much for the 20th door of our mbc

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,399
podcast

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
