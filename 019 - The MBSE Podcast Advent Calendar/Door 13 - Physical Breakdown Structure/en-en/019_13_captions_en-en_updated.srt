00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,337
Welcome to another door of the
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,160
Behind the 13th door, we take a look at
the Physical Architecture

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
In the last days, we presented
the Functional Architecture

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,405
As a reminder, let's open
the internal block diagram

5
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,780
of the Functional Architecture in the tool

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,115
We also have created
a Physical Architecture

7
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,527
of our MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

8
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:28,567
which specifies the physical entities
that implement the functional entities

9
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,579
from the Functional Architecture

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
The Physical Architecture is a
specialization of the Base Architecture

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,438
In this diagram the element with a
"system" stereotype with the name

12
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:43,280
The MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,879
It inherits most of the parts from the
system element TMPCT Base Architecture

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,158
As we have seen before we
used illustrations in this case

15
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:53,911
instead of the block notation

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:59,070
which makes it easier for unexperienced
users to understand the diagram

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,140
The blocks from our Functional
Architecture are allocated

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,400
to the blocks of the Physical Architecture

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,229
The allocation specifies which physical
block implements which function block

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,869
Let's see how we manage
the allocations in a matrix

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
The rows list the function blocks

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
The columns the physical blocks

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
And the cells the allocate relationship

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,630
Some functional blocks are mapped to
more than one physical block

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,073
And some physical blocks have more
than one allocated functional block

26
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,156
It is a rather rough mapping

27
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:37,282
So for example if a functional block is
allocated to multiple physical blocks

28
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:40,400
it is not clear
whether it is redundantly allocated

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
are only parts of the functional block

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
However, this is usually
sufficient in the model

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,583
More details if required can be introduced

32
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,319
by extending the allocate
relationship with a stereotype

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,880
As with the Functional Architecture

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
the more interesting part is the internal
structure of the Physical Architecture

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
with ports and connections

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,659
that we will cover tomorrow

37
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,130
So much for the 13th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,665
And we wish you a great 13th of December

39
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:11,515
Bye-bye

40
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,597
Goodbye
