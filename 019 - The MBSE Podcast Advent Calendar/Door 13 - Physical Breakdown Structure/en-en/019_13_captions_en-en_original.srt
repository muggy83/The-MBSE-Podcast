00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,120
welcome to another draw of the mbse

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,720
podcast advent calendar you have the

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,240
13th store we take a look at the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
physical architecture

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,160
in the last days we presented the

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,759
functional architecture

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
as a reminder let's open the internal

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,280
block diagram of the functional

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
architecture in the tool

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
we also have created a physical

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
architecture of our mbse podcast

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
christmas tree which specifies the

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
physical entities that implement the

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,119
functional entities from the functional

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
architecture

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,480
the physical architecture is a

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
specialization of the base architecture

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
in this diagram the element with a

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
system stereotype with the name the mbse

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
podcast christmas tree

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
it inherits most of the parts from the

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,879
system element tmpct base architecture

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,399
as we have seen before we used

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
illustrations in this case instead of

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
the block notation which makes it easier

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,280
for unexperienced users to understand

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
the diagram

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
the blocks from our functional

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
architecture are allocated to the blocks

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
of the physical architecture the

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,479
allocation specifies which physical

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,479
block implements which function block

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
let's see how we manage the allocations

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
in a matrix

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
the rows list the function blocks the

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
columns the physical blocks and the

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
cells the allocate relationship

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,920
some functional blocks are mapped to

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
more than one physical block and some

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,759
physical blocks have more than one

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,840
allocated functional block it is a

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
rather rough mapping so for example if a

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,759
functional block is allocated to

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
multiple physical blocks it is not clear

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
whether it is redundantly allocated

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
are only parts of the functional block

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
however this is usually sufficient in

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,920
the model

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
more details if required can be

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,520
introduced by extending the allocate

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,799
relationship with a stereotype

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,880
as with the functional architecture the

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
more interesting part is the internal

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,960
structure of the physical architecture

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
with ports and connections

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,399
that we will cover tomorrow

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
so much for the 13th store of our mbse

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
podcast event calendar and we wish you a

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
great 13th of december

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,520
bye goodbye
