00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,230
Welcome to the 19th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,320
Today we take a look at
the modelling of variants

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,772
Very often a system contains variants

4
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:13,920
So does our MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,009
We provide trees with different Christmas
stars, balls, stands, and fairy lights

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,410
So, let's look at our model of
how to define the variants

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,619
We restructured our model
from the simple system model

8
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,560
to our product line model

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,309
To do this, we have defined three
new packages at the top level

10
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:38,879
A "Core" package that contains all
elements that apply to all products

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,960
A "Variation" package that
contains the variable elements

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,755
And a package that
contains the configurations

13
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,960
For example, product definitions

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,799
Our previous packages are now all
rearranged below the Core package

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,050
In the "TMPCT_Variations" package

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,277
there is a package diagram that
shows the product line

17
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,359
in the form of a feature tree the

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,119
A Variation packages represent
the discriminator variability

19
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,320
Here it is generally only the kinds

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
The "minVariant" "maxVariant" properties

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,560
specify how many of the variants may be
in a valid configuration at the same time

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
Mostly it is exactly one

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
An exception here is the
"Christmas Ball Kinds" variation

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,960
Here also two variants may be contained
at the same time in a configuration

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,687
The variant packages each contain all
exclusive model elements

26
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,840
only required by a variant

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Constraints can be defined
between the variants

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,840
Typically variant constraints are
"REQUIRES and "XOR"

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
A "REQUIRES" constraint is defined

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
between the "Premium Star"
and the "Large Stand" variants

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
In example

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
if the "Premium Star" variant is selected

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,600
the "Large Stand" variant must also be
selected for a valid configuration

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
The variant "Premium Star" defines
a special Christmas star

35
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
that has an LED starlight

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
The "Premium Christmas Star" block

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,000
specializes the common
"Christmas Tree Star" block from the Core

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,100
The Configuration package contains
the variant configurations

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,879
which are specifications of concrete
products of the product line

40
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,660
Three defined editions of our
MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

41
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,239
are "Echo", "Premium", and "Standard"

42
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,360
Each configuration selects
the contained variants

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
which can be perfectly done in a matrix

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,660
The selection is modeled by
a package import relationship

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,183
Here we have intentionally included an
error for demonstration purposes

46
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:54,530
The configuration
"TMPCT Premium Edition"

47
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,760
has selected the variant premium style

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,503
That requires constraints
described as requires

49
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:05,633
that the variant "Large Stand"
but then also be selected

50
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:09,680
But we have selected
the variant "Standard Stand"

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The arrow is automatically displayed
in the matrix you see the red one

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,288
As already mentioned

53
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:21,440
the requires constraint is
a stereotype from the SYSMOD profile

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,920
and also contains an OCL constraint
that checks compliance with the rule

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
This is completely based on standards

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,790
The only tool specific here is that the
tool is able to evaluate the OCL statement

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,649
The block definition diagram shows a part

58
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:45,911
of the definition of the
"TMPCT Premium Edition"

59
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,790
The edition itself is a system element

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,940
that specializes the system
element from the "Core"

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,640
As an example, it is shown how the
"Premium Star" edition is implemented

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,877
The premium Christmas star is
explicitly defined as a part property

63
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:07,839
that redefines the inherited
property of the general star

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,671
So much for the 19th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

65
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,400
And we wish you a great 19th of December

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,209
Bye-bye

67
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,219
Goodbye
