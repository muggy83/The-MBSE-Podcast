00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to the 19th store of our nbc

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
podcast advent calendar today we take a

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,720
look at the modelling of variants

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
very often a system contains variants so

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,920
does our mbse podcast christmas tree

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,440
we provide trees with different

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,840
christmas stars balls stands and fairy

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,359
lights

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
so let's look at our model of how to

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
define the variants

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,279
we restructured our model from the

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,279
simple system model to our product line

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
model

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,640
to do this we have defined three new

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
packages at the top level a core package

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
that contains all elements that apply to

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
all products

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
a variation package that contains the

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
variable elements

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
and a package that contains the

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,719
configurations for example product

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,960
definitions

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
our previous packages are now all

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
rearranged below the core package

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,320
in the tmpct variations package there is

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
a package diagram that shows the product

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
line in the form of a feature tree the

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
variation packages represent the

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,119
discriminator variability

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,320
here it is generally only the kinds

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
the min variance max variance properties

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,759
specify how many of the variants may be

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
in a valid configuration at the same

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,560
time

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
mostly it is exactly one

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
an exception here is the christmas ball

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
kinds variation

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
here also two variants may be contained

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
at the same time in a configuration

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,000
the variant packages each contain all

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
exclusive model elements only required

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
by a variant

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
constraints can be defined between the

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,880
variants

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,759
typically variant constraints are

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
requires and xor

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
a requires constraint is defined between

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
the premium star and the large stand

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
variants

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
in example

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
if the premium star variant is selected

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,360
the large stand variant must also be

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
selected for a valid configuration

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,560
the variant premium star defines a

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
special christmas star

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,598
that has

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
an led starlight

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
the premium christmas star block

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
specializes the common christmas

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
tree star block from the core

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
the configuration package contains the

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
variant configurations which are

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
specifications of concrete products of

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
the product line

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,280
three defined editions of our mbse

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
podcast christmas tree are echo premium

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
and standard

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,239
each configuration selects the contained

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,360
variants

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
which can be perfectly done in a matrix

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
the selection is modeled by a package

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
import relationship

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
here we have intentionally included an

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
error for demonstration purposes the

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
configuration tmpct premium edition has

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
selected the variant premium style

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
the requires constraint described

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
requires that the variant large stand

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
but then also be selected but we have

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
selected the variant standard stand

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
the arrow is automatically displayed in

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
the matrix you see the red

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
one

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
as already mentioned the requires

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
constraint is a stereotype from the

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
sysmod profile

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
and also

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
contains an ocl constraint that checks

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
compliance with the rule

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
this is completely based on standards

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
the only tool specific here is that the

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
tool is able to evaluate the ocl

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
statement

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,239
the block definition diagram shows a

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,799
part of the definition of the tmpct

96
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
premium edition the edition itself is a

97
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
system element that specializes the

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
system element from the call

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
as an example it is shown how the

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
premium star edition is implemented

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,959
the premium christmas star is explicitly

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
defined as a part property that

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
redefines the inherited property of the

104
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,480
general star

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
so much for the 19th store of our mbc

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
a great 19th of december bye-bye

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,399
goodbye
