00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome to the ninth door of the mbse

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,000
podcast advent calendar

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
this time we take a look at the state

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,920
machines

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
here we use a state machine to specify

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,120
the top level states of our system

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
and with that the pre and post

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
conditions of the use cases this state

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
machine is owned by the system element

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
so let's look at it in the model

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
the state machine considers four states

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,599
of the christmas tree which are packed

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
ready to use operation and disposed

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
do you remember the triggers of our use

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
cases

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,239
we specified a textual trigger as well

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
as a formal signal model element for the

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,520
trigger

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
the use case trigger signals triggers

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
the transitions in our state machine

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
the use case activities are the effect

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
of the transitions or internal behaviors

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
of the states

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
the special learning surprise you cannot

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
directly set the use case activity on a

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
transition or a state because they must

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
own the activity however the use case

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
activity is already owned by the use

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,200
case

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
the trick is to define an activity with

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
a single call behavior action which

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
calls the use case activity

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,479
for example the effect of the do

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,520
behavior of the operation state

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,240
we find that in this region

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
there's the operation state and inside

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
the operation state

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
is the activity

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
the activity does not need an initial or

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
final note it is sufficient to just

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
model the call behavior action

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
so much for the ninth store of our mdse

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
podcast i met calendar and we wish you a

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
great night for december

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,799
bye-bye goodbye
