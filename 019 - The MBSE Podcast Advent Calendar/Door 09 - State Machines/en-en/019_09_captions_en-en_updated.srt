00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to the 9th door of the
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,507
This time we take a look at
the State Machines

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,120
Here we use a State Machine to specify
the top level states of our system

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,138
And with that the pre and post
conditions of the Use Cases

5
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:21,840
This State Machine is
owned by the system element

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,540
So, let's look at it in the model

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,213
The State Machine considers four
states of the Christmas tree

8
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:35,739
which are "Packed", "Ready to use"
"Operation" and "Disposed"

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,520
Do you remember the triggers
of our Use Cases?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,049
We specified a textual trigger

11
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:45,520
as well as a formal signal model
element for the trigger

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,179
The Use Case trigger signals trigger
the transitions in our State Machine

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,630
The Use Case Activities are
the effect of the transitions

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,440
or internal behaviors of the states

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,060
The special learning surprise

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,870
you cannot directly set the
Use Case Activity on a transition

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,023
or a state because they
must own the activity

18
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:12,680
however the Use Case Activity is
already owned by the Use Case

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
The trick is to define an activity with
a single call behavior action

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
which calls the Use Case Activity

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
for example, the effect of the
do behavior of the operation state

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,240
we find that in this region

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,310
there's the operation state and inside
the operation state is the activity

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,549
The activity does not need
an initial or final node

25
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,760
It is sufficient to just model
the call behavior action

26
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,661
So much for the 9th store of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

27
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,399
And we wish you a great 9th of December

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,119
Bye-bye

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,870
Goodbye
