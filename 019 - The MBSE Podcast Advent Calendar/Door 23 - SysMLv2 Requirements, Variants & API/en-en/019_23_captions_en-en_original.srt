00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to the 23rd door of our mbse

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,319
podcast advent calendar today we show

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,000
you some more aspects of the next

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,920
generation modeling language system v2

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
yesterday we showed a simplified

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,759
physical architecture of our christmas

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,400
tree in system lv2

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
today we will briefly look at

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
requirements the modeling of variants

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
and the system lv2 api

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
first let's open our jupyter notebook

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
again

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
a quick reminder of what we already have

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
it is a simple physical architecture

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
that specifies the parts of our

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,399
christmas tree and their connections

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
now we look at the requirements

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
we import a part of the requirements

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,520
from the international christmas tree

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
standard ics 242526-12

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
which is modeled here with only one

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,320
requirement

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,440
the

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,359
ics-2054-2526 requirement rec tree hate

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,080
is a requirement definition it specifies

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,640
the name rectory hate the requirement

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
text after the doc keyword and an

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
attribute 38 to formally specify the

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
constraint that the height of the tree

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
must be between 150 and 200.

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
in the package tmpct underscore

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,759
requirements

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,040
we use the defined ics 24 26 27

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
requirement

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,280
our tmpct requirement height of the tree

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
is a usage of the requirement definition

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
rec tree height

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
in addition we specify a requirement id

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
rec1

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
and redefine the tree height attribute

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
by setting it to the value of the

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
appropriate value property of our

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,439
christmas tree

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
the visualization of the requirements is

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
not very exciting among other things

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,119
because we have not used relationships

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,799
next we have a brief look at how to

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
model variants because this is a hot

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,038
topic in mbse

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,440
first we take our tmpct physical

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,319
architecture again

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
the variability is defined in two

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
additional packages in the tmpct

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
variations package we define an abstract

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
christmas tree variations part that

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
contains the variations which constrain

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
the allowed variants the keyword and

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
concept variation in system v2 is

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
similar to the concept of a variation

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
point

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
for example we specified that our part

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,239
christmas tree star can have one of the

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,440
three variants aqua star premium star or

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
standard star

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
we also defined another variation for

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,200
the part christmas tree stand

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
in addition we defined a constraint that

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
specifies

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
if the premium star variant is selected

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
you must select the large stand variant

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
the variants are defined in another

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
package tmpct variants very simple we

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
just defined the parts only the premium

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,760
star part owns another part led light

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
the visualization of the model depicts

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
some new special system lv2 notation

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
elements for the variants

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
it shows the specified variance of a

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,480
variation by a relationship

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
finally we defined two products of our

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
mbse podcast christmas tree the echo

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
tree

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
subsets the abstract part christmas tree

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,080
variations and selects the ecostar and

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
the standard style variants

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,640
the premium tree selects the premium

87
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,159
star and the large stent variant

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
we close this episode with a brief look

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,239
at the sysml v2 api

90
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,640
we can publish our model to a sysmlv2

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
repository server which is provided by

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
the company intercax

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
to have everything in one model in one

94
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
model we put all our previous packages

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,159
into one package called tmpct

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
the publish command posts the model to

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
the intercax server where we can access

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
our model via the system lv2 api

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
through the swagger ui you can use the

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
api in the browser as an example we show

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
how to view the list of projects in the

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
system lv2 repository

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
with the project number you could then

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
get to the comments via the api and via

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
project and commit number than the

106
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,120
elements of the model

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
so much for the 23rd door of our amazing

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

109
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
a great 23rd of december

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,560
bye bye
