00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,473
Welcome to the 23rd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,540
Today we show you some more aspects

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,680
of the next generation
modeling language SysML v2

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,783
Yesterday we showed a
simplified Physical Architecture

5
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:18,400
of our Christmas tree in SysML v2

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,601
Today we will briefly
look at requirements

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,680
the modeling of variants
and the SysML v2 API

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,330
First, let's open our
Jupyter Notebook again

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
A quick reminder of what we already have

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
It is a simple Physical Architecture

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,960
that specifies the parts of our
Christmas tree and their connections

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
Now we look at the requirements

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
We import a part of the requirements

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
from the International Christmas
Tree Standard, ICS242526_12

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,100
which is modeled here with
only one requirement

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
The ICS242526_12 requirement
"ReqTreeHeight"

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,035
is a requirement definition

18
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:07,965
It specifies the name "ReqTreeHeight"

19
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:10,700
the requirement text after the doc keyword

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,443
and an attribute "treeHeight"
to formally specify the constraint

21
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:20,590
that the height of the tree
must be between 150 and 200

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
In the package "TMPCT_Requirements"

23
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
we use the defined
ICS242526_12 requirement

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Our TMPCT_Requirement
"Height of the Tree"

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
is a usage of the requirement
definition "ReqTreeHeight"

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
In addition we specify
a requirement ID "REQ1"

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
and redefine the "treeHeight" attribute

28
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,031
by setting it to the value

29
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:51,360
of the appropriate value property
of our Christmas tree

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
The visualization of the requirements is
not very exciting among other things

31
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,119
because we have not used relationships

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,812
Next, we have a brief look at
how to model variants

33
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:09,038
because this is a hot topic in MBSE

34
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,990
First, we take our
"TMPCT_PhysicalArchitecture" again

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,613
The variability is defined in
two additional packages

36
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,900
In the "TMPCT_Variations" package

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,069
we define an abstract
"christmasTreeVariations" part

38
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,587
that contains the variations
which constrain the allowed variants

39
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:31,722
The keyword and concept
variation in SysML v2

40
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,560
is similar to the concept
of a variation point

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,183
For example, we specified that
our part "christmasTreeStar"

42
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,368
can have one of the three variant

43
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:45,979
"ecoStar", "premiumStar"
or "standardStar"

44
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,200
We also defined another variation for
the part "christmasTreeStand"

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,480
In addition, we defined
a constraint that specifies

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
if the "premiumStar" variant is selected

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,900
you must select the "largeStand" variant

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,663
the variants are defined in another
package "TMPCT_Variants"

49
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,811
very simple we just defined the parts

50
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:13,430
Only the "premiumStar" part
owns another part "ledLight"

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
The visualization of the model depicts

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
some new special SysML v2
notation elements for the variants

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,230
It shows the specified variance
of a variation by a relationship

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,173
Finally we defined two products of our
MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

55
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:35,996
The "echoTree" subsets the abstract part
"christmasTreeVariations"

56
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:40,239
and selects the "ecoStar" and
the "standardStand" variants

57
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,530
the "premiumTree" selects the
"premiumStar" and the "largeStand" variant

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,219
We close this episode with a
brief look at the SysML v2 API

59
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,870
We can publish our model to
a SysML v2 repository server

60
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,200
which is provided by
the company Intercax

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,667
To have everything in one model

62
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:08,340
we put all our previous packages
into one package called TMPCT

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,839
The publish command posts
the model to the Intercax server

64
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:21,660
where we can access our
model via the SysML v2 API

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,302
Through the Swagger UI
you can use the API in the browser

66
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,570
As an example

67
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,400
we show how to view the list of
projects in the SysML v2 repository

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,956
With the project number you could then
get to the comments via the API

69
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:45,270
And via project and commit number
then the elements of the model

70
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,330
So much for the 23rd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

71
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,171
And we wish you a great 23rd of December

72
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:59,056
Bye-bye
