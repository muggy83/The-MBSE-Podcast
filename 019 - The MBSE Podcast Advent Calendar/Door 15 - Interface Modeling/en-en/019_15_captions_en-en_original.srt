00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,679
welcome to the 15th store of our mbse

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,759
podcast event calendar today we take a

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,800
look at the modeling of interfaces

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
typically you use ports type by

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
interface blocks with a connector you

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
model the connection between two ports

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
let's have a look at our physical

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,359
architecture in the model

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,119
the connection between the trunk and the

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,880
stand is a typical interface

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,279
specification two ports type by

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,079
interface block named standport

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,040
connected with a connector

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,520
today we show you a way to specify an

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
interface in more detail a connector can

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
be typed by an association or

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
association block

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
an association block can define details

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
of the connection

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
the following block definition diagram

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
shows the definition of the association

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
block

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
plug socket interface between two

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
interface blocks plug port and socket

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,199
port each with nested ports

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
in addition the association block has a

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
part property specifying the power cable

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
with length of 200 centimeters

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
like any other block an association

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
block can have an internal structure

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,400
which is depicted in the internal block

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
diagram

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
the dashed rectangles on the left and

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,840
the right are the references to the

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
association and typed by the interface

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,280
blocks

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
with the nested ports

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
here we have modeled a simple structure

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,520
by connecting the nested ports directly

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
this interface definition is applied

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
between the external power supply and

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,640
our christmas tree as depicted in the

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
following diagram

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
so much for the 15th door of our mbse

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,280
a great 15th of december
