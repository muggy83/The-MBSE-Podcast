00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,009
Welcome to the 15th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,480
Today we take a look at
the modeling of interfaces

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,212
Typically you use ports
typed by interface blocks

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,270
With a connector you model
the connection between two ports

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,530
Let's have a look at our
Physical Architecture in the model

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,719
The connection between
the "trunk" and the "stand"

7
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,063
is a typical interface specification

8
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:32,079
Two ports type by interface block
named "StandPort"

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,820
connected with a connector

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,104
Today we show you a way to
specify an interface in more detail

11
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:43,520
A connector can be typed by
an association or association block

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,690
An association block can define
details of the connection

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
The following block definition diagram

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,250
shows the definition of the association
block "PlugSockectInterface"

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,030
between two interface blocks
"PlugPort" and "SocketPort"

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,967
each with nested ports

17
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:07,180
In addition the association
block has a part property

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,970
specifying the "powerCable"
with length of 200 centimeters

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
Like any other block, an association
block can have an internal structure

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,850
which is depicted in
the internal block diagram

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,840
The dashed rectangles on the left
and the right are the references

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
to the association and typed
by the interface blocks

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
with the nested ports

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
Here we have modeled a simple structure

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,150
by connecting the nested ports directly

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,650
This interface definition is applied

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,419
between the external power supply
and our Christmas tree

28
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:47,350
as depicted in the following diagram

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,470
So much for the 15th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

30
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,642
And we wish you a great 15th of December
