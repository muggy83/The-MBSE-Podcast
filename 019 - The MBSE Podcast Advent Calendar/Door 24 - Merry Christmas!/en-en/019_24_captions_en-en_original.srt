00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,919
ho ho ho and welcome to the 24th and

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,160
final door of our mbse podcast advent

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,839
calendar

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,080
today is a special day for many

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
we will avoid burdening your brain with

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,080
modelling topics today

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
instead we will end by in lighting up

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
our christmas tree

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,680
this can also be done much more amazing

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,359
with more effort

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,359
model simulations can be provided with

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
graphical interfaces in order to play

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,599
around with the system at an early stage

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
before anything has been implemented

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
finally here's a little gift from us

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
our mbse podcast cruising stream model

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
you can download it as a camera model or

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
as an xmi model from our website

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,920
mbse-podcast.rocks

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
and you can play around with it by

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,199
yourself

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,760
