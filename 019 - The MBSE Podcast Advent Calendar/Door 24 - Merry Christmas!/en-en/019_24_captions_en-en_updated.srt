00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,799
Ho ho ho

2
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:07,529
And welcome to the 24th and final door
of our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,080
Today is a special day for many

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,800
We will avoid burdening your brain
with modelling topics today

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,920
Instead, we will end by in
lighting up our Christmas tree

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
This can also be done much
more amazing with more effort

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,399
Model simulations can be
provided with graphical interfaces

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,599
In order to play around with
the system at an early stage

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,350
before anything has been implemented

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
Finally here's a little gift from us

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
Our MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree model

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
You can download it as a Cameo model

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
or as an XMI model from our website

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
mbse-podcast.rocks

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
And you can play around
with it by yourself

16
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,760
Next year we will see and hear you again

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
in the usual way

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
We will soon announce the first dates

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,779
with new exciting topics via our website
and social media channels

20
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,380
Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,130
We wish you all a Merry Christmas

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,710
A Happy New Year

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,610
And stay healthy

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,920
Bye-bye

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
Goodbye
