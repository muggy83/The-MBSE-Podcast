00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,960
welcome behind the eight door of our

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,600
mbse podcast advent calendar we take a

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
look at the domain knowledge model

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
for the object flows in the use case

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
activities we have defined the types of

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,040
flowing objects

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,119
these are mostly blocks and value types

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,320
of the domain knowledge model

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
or put in another way the domain

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,160
knowledge model defines the types of

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
objects that the system uses in its

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,599
functions

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
so let's take a look at the model and

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
look again on the use case activity

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
enjoy christmas tree

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
there are only a few object types in

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
this diagram like si power hi light and

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,920
flashing program

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,480
the prefix si indicates that this is an

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
object type that occurs in a system

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
interface to another system

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,800
in the prefix hi indicates that this is

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
an object type that occurs in a

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,920
systematic phase to a human

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
these types are defined besides others

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
in the domain knowledge model which is

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
partially depicted in the falling block

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
definition diagram

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,760
the value type centimeter is a

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,159
specialization of the primitive type

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,640
integer from the system library

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
it is our decision that we take integer

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
values for centimeter an alternative for

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
example would be real

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
system l also explicitly supports the

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,119
modeling of units however we did not use

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,960
that for simplicity

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
of course all these types from the

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,320
domain knowledge model are good

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
candidates for a modern library

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
the domain knowledge represents the

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
knowledge of your system

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
if you ask your system do you know the

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,119
concept of flashing program it can

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,159
answer sure of course i know this i know

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
it like it's defined in the domain block

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,960
if you ask the system about christmas

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
gifts is has no clue what you are

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
talking about

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,840
much for the eight door of our mbse

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,560
a great 8th of december

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
goodbye

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,159
bye
