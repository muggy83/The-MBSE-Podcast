00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,691
Welcome behind the 8th door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:08,542
We take a look at the
Domain Knowledge Model

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,775
For the object flows in
the Use Case Activities

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,040
We have defined the
types of flowing objects

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,320
These are mostly blocks and value types
of the Domain Knowledge Model

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,597
Or put in another way

7
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:24,721
The Domain Knowledge Model
defines the types of objects

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,599
that the system uses in its functions

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,181
So, let's take a look
at the model

10
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,249
and look again on the Use Case Activity
"Enjoy Christmas tree"

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,439
There are only a few object
types in this diagram

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,920
like "SI_Power", "HI_Light" and
"Flashing Program"

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,319
The prefix "SI_" indicates that
this is an object type

14
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:48,239
that occurs in a system
interface to another system

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,944
In the prefix "HI_" indicates that
this is an object type

16
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:55,229
that occurs in a systematic
phase to a human

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,436
These types are defined besides others
in the Domain Knowledge Model

18
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:04,490
which is partially depicted in
the following block definition diagram

19
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,159
The value type "Centimeter" is a
specialization of the primitive type

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,640
"Integer" from the SysML library

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,660
It is our decision that we take
"Integer" values for "Centimeter"

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,080
an alternative for example
would be "Real"

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
SysML also explicitly supports
the modeling of units

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
However we did not use
that for simplicity

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,940
Of course, all these types from
the Domain Knowledge Model

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,320
are good candidates
for a modern library

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
The Domain Knowledge represents
the knowledge of your system

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,670
If you ask your system do you know
the concept of "Flashing Program"

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,159
it can answer
"Sure, of course I know this"

30
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
"I know it like it's defined
in the domain block"

31
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,540
If you ask the system
about "Christmas Gifts"

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,157
it has no clue what
you are talking about

33
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,128
So much for the 8th door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

34
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:59,770
And we wish you a great 8th of December

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
Goodbye

36
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:03,279
Bye-bye
