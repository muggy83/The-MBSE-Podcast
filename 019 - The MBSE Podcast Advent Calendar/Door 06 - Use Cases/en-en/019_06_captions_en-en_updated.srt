00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,602
Welcome behind the 6th door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:07,790
We take a look at the System Use Cases

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,373
There are a lot of methods for
modeling use cases

4
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:14,610
published in many books papers
and other publications

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,170
We present a very simple method
and avoid use case relationships

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,929
such as include, extend
or generalization

7
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:23,059
between the use cases

8
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:27,249
The use cases here are simply a list
of the functions of the system

9
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:32,960
in which actors are involved and which
create value for an actor or stakeholder

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,830
So, let's have a look in the model

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,108
Some of our use cases of the
"MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree"

12
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:49,999
are depicted in the use case diagram
with the associated actors

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
There are a few special
features in the modeling

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,659
The actor "Carrier" of the use case
"Transport Christmas tree"

15
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,160
is a generalization of the actor's
"Christmas Tree Seller" and "Owner"

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,120
It is an XOR condition

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,400
So, the use case has only one actor which
could be either the "Seller" or an "Owner"

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
The association end at the "Child" actor
has a multiplicity zero to many

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
which means that Children are optional

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
But they could be

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
there could be many of them

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,780
who are enjoying the Christmas tree

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,920
Although use case diagrams
are very common

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,270
They just show more or less only
a graphical list of use cases

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:39,390
you can depict the same information
in a table plus more properties

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,729
The table shows also documentation
of the use case

27
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,369
as well as additional properties

28
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,119
introduced by the SYSMOD
stereotype "systemUseCase"

29
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,320
for the trigger and
the result of the use case

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
The trigger signal property stores a

31
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
signal to formalize the trigger
when the use case is executed

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,990
You will meet it again when
we talk about state machines

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,740
And that's the learning surprise
behind the store

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,400
Tables are valid use of
SysML model elements

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,239
And they can be much more
convenient than a diagram

36
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,483
You do not have the layout effort

37
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:16,446
And depending on the tool

38
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:20,239
tables are typically queries
and always up to date

39
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,180
Use the tables for the daily
engineering work and diagrams

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,510
for workshops presentations
or eventually documents

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
So much for the 6th door of the
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
We wish you a great 6th of December

43
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,540
Goodbye
