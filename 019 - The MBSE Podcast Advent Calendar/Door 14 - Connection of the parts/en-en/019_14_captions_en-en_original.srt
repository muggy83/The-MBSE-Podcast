00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,399
welcome

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,880
behind the 14th store for mbse podcast

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,359
advent calendar we take a look again on

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
the physical architecture

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,679
yesterday we worked on the definition of

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,840
the physical architecture and the

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,280
allocation of the elements from the

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
functional architecture

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
let's have a look at it again in the

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,800
model

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
today we will cover the internal

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,840
structure of the physical architecture

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,840
the internal block diagram shows all

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
parts and connections of our physical

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
architecture

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
it's somewhat simplified here and we

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
have not explicitly modeled all of the

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,960
ports

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
as a reminder you can identify the

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
inherited elements by the circumflex

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
symbol before the name

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
if the system is more complex

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
you will have more internal block

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,800
diagrams

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
on the one hand different diagrams on

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
the different hierarchical levels of the

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
system and on the other hand diagrams

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
for different aspects for example

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
internal block diagrams that only show

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,119
logical or internal block diagrams that

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,159
show only electrical connections

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,479
or entire block diagrams that only show

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
the connections necessary for a specific

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
use case

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
so much for the 14th store of our mbse

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,840
a great 14th of

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,320
december bye-bye goodbye
