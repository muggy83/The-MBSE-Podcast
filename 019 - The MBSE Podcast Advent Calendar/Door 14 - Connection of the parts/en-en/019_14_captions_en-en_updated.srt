00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,399
Welcome

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,721
Behind the 14th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:09,049
We take a look again on
the Physical Architecture

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,932
Yesterday we worked on the definition
of the Physical Architecture

5
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:16,880
and the allocation of the elements
from the functional architecture

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,130
Let's have a look at it again in the model

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,430
Today we will cover the internal
structure of the Physical Architecture

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,141
The internal block diagram shows
all parts and connections

9
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,440
of our Physical Architecture

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,305
It's somewhat simplified here

11
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,960
and we have not explicitly
modeled all of the ports

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,406
as a reminder, you can identify
the inherited elements

13
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:49,690
by the circumflex symbol before the name

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If the system is more complex

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
you will have more internal block diagrams

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,830
On the one hand

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,421
different diagrams on the different
hierarchical levels of the system

18
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,580
And on the other hand

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,461
diagrams for different aspects

20
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,327
for example internal block diagrams

21
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:07,119
that only show logical
or internal block diagrams

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,159
that show only electrical connections

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,479
Or entire block diagrams that only show

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,110
the connections necessary
for a specific use case

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
So much for the 14th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,500
And we wish you a great 14th of December

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Bye-bye

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,690
Goodbye
