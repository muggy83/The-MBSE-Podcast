00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,804
Hello, behind the 4th door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:08,350
We take a look at Base Architectures

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,080
We already mentioned the Base
Architecture in the previous days

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,860
Now let's talk about what it is

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
In systems engineering, we distinguish
the problem space and the solution space

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,990
For example, the requirements are in
the problem space and are solution free

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,150
And the system architecture
is in the solution space

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,360
and satisfies the requirements

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,552
Sounds simple but it's not

10
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:35,760
What does it mean that
requirements are solution free

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
So, what even is a solution

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,623
So, can a requirement request
a vehicle that has four wheels?

13
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:45,570
Or is wheel already a solution?

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,444
The separation of problem
and solution space is correct

15
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:52,593
what is missing is a consideration

16
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:54,686
that there are several levels of it

17
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:58,269
As solution space on
one level is the basis

18
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,980
for the problem space
on the next level

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,679
To return to the vehicle example

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,040
on one level we have requirements
in the problem space

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
that the system should be
able to move on roads

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,683
In the solution space we have
chosen the concept of wheel

23
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,520
as one alternative

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,800
In the architecture to
satisfy these requirements

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,076
This architecture is the basis
for the next level

26
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:26,669
The wheel is assumed and
we now set the requirement

27
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:31,119
that there should be four wheels
with the size and so on

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,643
The system architecture from the
higher level solution space

29
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,600
we call our Base Architecture

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,797
When we describe them explicitly

31
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:43,225
we more strongly separate the problem
space from the solution space

32
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,799
and make implicit assumptions explicit

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,079
The decisions in the Base Architecture are
constraint requirements for the next level

34
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,830
So, now let's have a look on our model

35
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,560
The Base Architecture is modeled here
in the "TMPCT_BaseArchitecture" package

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,490
and here we find the Base
Architecture definition diagram

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
So, the Base Architecture of our
Christmas tree already specifies a lot

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,719
since the basic structure of
a Christmas tree is fixed

39
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,870
and not part of our solution space

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,048
The diagram shows the definition of the
elements in the block definition diagram

41
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:31,120
Our "MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree"
abbreviated "TMPCT"

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,940
Base Architecture includes
a "Transportation Net"

43
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,330
a "Tree" with a "Trunk" and "Branches"
a "Christmas Tree", "Star"

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,120
"Fairy Lights", a "Stand", and
a "Transportation Package"

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,920
SysML, a modeling tools allows us to
use images instead of SysML shapes

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,800
This makes it more illustrative

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,710
The Base Architecture also leads
to a Base System Context

48
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,319
which we define in the following
block definition diagram

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
External actors are
the "Floor" in a "Room"

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Of course "Santa Claus"

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,268
the "Owner" of the tree
eventual "Children", a "Power Supply"

52
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,620
the "Planet Environment"
for sustainability considerations

53
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,100
and the "TMPCT_BaseArchitecture" itself

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
Depicted in an internal block diagram

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
shows the typical figure of
a system context diagram here

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,480
It is the context of our Base Architecture

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,595
We left out most of the connections
inside our Christmas tree

58
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:33,920
they will be defined later in the
Physical Architecture of our system

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,350
When we look at those

60
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,952
we also see how the relationship to
the Base Architecture can be modeled

61
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:44,020
we will explain the concept of ports
connectors and part properties

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,570
in later sessions

63
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,300
When we consider the system context

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,019
we will cover how the system context is
related to the Base Architecture Context

65
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
So, what was the surprise behind this door

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
It's the Base Architecture itself
that makes it special

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,357
It's always there but is
often carelessly documented

68
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:11,638
the blurring between the problem
space and the solution space

69
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,260
as well as implicit assumptions

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,339
leads to many potential problems
in development projects

71
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
So much for the 4th door of
our MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,960
And we wish you a great 4th of December

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Goodbye

74
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,850
Bye-bye
