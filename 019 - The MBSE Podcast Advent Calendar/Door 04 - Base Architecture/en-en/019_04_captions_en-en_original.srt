00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,360
hello behind the fourth door of our mbse

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
podcast advent calendar we take a look

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,720
at base architectures

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,000
we already mentioned the base

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,080
architecture in the previous days

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
now let's talk about what it is

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
in systems engineering we distinguish

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,840
the problem space at the solution space

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,920
for example the requirements are in the

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
problem space and are solution free and

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
the system architecture is in the

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
solution space and satisfies the

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,240
requirements

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,719
sounds simple but it's not

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,480
what does it mean that requirements are

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,760
solution free

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,040
so

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,120
what even is a solution

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,360
so can a requirement request a vehicle

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160
that has four wheels or is wheel already

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
a solution

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
the separation of problem and solution

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
space is correct what is missing is a

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
consideration that there are several

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,559
levels of it as solution space on one

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,199
level is the basis for the problem space

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
on the next level

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
to return to the vehicle example on one

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,760
level we have requirements in the

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
problem space

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
that the system should be able to move

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
on roads

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
in the solution space we have chosen the

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
concept of wheel as one alternative

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
in the architecture to satisfy these

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
requirements

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
this architecture is the basis for the

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,119
next level the wheel is assumed and we

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,960
now set the requirement that there

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
should be four wheels with the size and

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,439
so on

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
the system architecture from the higher

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
level solution space we call our base

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,600
architecture

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
when we describe them explicitly we more

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
strongly separate the problem space from

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,640
the solution space and make implicit

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
assumptions explicit

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,479
the decisions in the base architecture

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
are constraint requirements for the next

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
level

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,560
so now let's have a look on our model

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,119
the base architecture

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
is modeled here in the base architecture

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
package and here we find the base

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
architecture definition diagram

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
so the base architecture of our

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
christmas tree

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
already specifies a lot

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
since the basic structure of a christmas

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,599
tree is fixed and not part of our

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
solution space the diagram shows the

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
definition of the elements in the block

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
definition diagram our mbse podcast

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
christmas tree abbreviated tmpct

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
base architecture includes a

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,959
transportation net a tree with a trunk

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
and branches a christmas tree star fairy

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
lights a stand and a transportation

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
package

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
system a modeling tools allows us to use

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
images instead of system shapes this

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
makes it more illustrative

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
the base architecture also leads to a

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
base system context which we define in

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
the following block definition diagram

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
external actors are the floor in a room

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
of course santa claus

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
the owner of the tree eventual children

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,560
a power supply the planet environment

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
for sustainability considerations and

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
the tmpct base architecture itself

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
depicted in an internal block diagram

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
shows the typical figure of a system

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
context diagram here

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
it is the context of our base

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
architecture

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
we left out most of the connections

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
inside our christmas tree they will be

90
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,840
defined later in the physical

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
architecture of our system

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,560
when we look at those we also see how

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
the relationship to the base

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
architecture can be modeled we will

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
explain the concept of ports connectors

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,840
and part properties in later

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,200
sessions when we consider the system

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
context we will cover how the system

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
context is related to the base

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
architecture context

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
so what was the surprise behind this

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,480
door

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
it's the base architecture itself that

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
makes it special

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
it's always there but is often

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,959
carelessly documented the blurring

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
between the problem space and the

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
solution space as well as implicit

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,799
assemb assumptions

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
leads to many potential problems in

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
development projects

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
so much for the fourth daw of our mbse

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
a great 4th of december

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
goodbye bye bye
