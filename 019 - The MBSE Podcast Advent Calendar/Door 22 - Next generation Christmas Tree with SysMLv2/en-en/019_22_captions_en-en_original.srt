00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to the 22nd door of our mbse

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
podcast advent calendar

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,559
today we travel to the future and model

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,280
our great mbse podcast christmas tree

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,719
with the next generation modeling

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,759
language sysmlv2

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,279
system rb2 is currently under

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
development it will be officially

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,279
available probably in 2023 or 2024 so

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,519
there's still some time however it is

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
already interesting to take a look at it

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,199
now in order to set the cost in good

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
time two to three years is a very short

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
time in relation to major changes in the

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
process and tool landscape in mbsd

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,320
the csml submission team sst for short

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,760
is currently working on the

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,719
specification of system lv2 what is

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
great is that they also provide a pilot

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,239
implementation so that you can

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120
experiment with system lv2

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
we use the pilot implementation based on

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
jupiter lab to show you some more or

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
less equivalent system lv2 models of our

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
christmas tree

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
to avoid having to set up a jupiter lab

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
environment yourself my company also

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
provides a ready-to-use implementation

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,520
at

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,320
systemlv2lab.com

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
here you will find a general

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
introduction to system level 2 the

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
current state of the specification and

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
many examples you can also create your

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
own models and play around with them but

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
be aware from time to time the server

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
will be restarted and all files will be

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
lost if you want to save your models you

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,799
have to download them manually

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
we have already uploaded our jupyter

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
notebook for the mbse podcast christmas

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,079
tree

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,720
system lv2 offers a textual notation in

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,799
addition to the graphical notation known

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
from system lv1

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
to create the models in the pilot

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
implementation

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
one has to use the textual notation and

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
then can generate the graphical notation

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
automatically

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,799
later there will probably be graphical

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
editors for system lv2 as well

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,680
so let's have a look into the jupyter

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
lab

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,040
our tmpct model is a simplified version

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,759
of our system lv1 physical architecture

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,440
of the christmas tree

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,239
we have directly modeled the parts

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
they have no explicit type here

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
simplified in system will be one it

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
would mean to define part properties

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
without blocks

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
what works in system v2 but not in

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
system v1

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
is that the parts can also define

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
structures themselves as you can see

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
here for example with the part 3 which

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
defines the trunk the branches

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,879
and an attribute for the head of the

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
tree

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
if no type is defined however a type

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
from the system library of system lv2 is

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
implicitly set in the background

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,480
also a part

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,879
always needs a context

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
if this is not given

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
as for example with our top level part

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
the mbse podcast christmas tree

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
then the element anything from the

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
kermal base library is set as the

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
context as the context for the element

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
by the way kernel is the meta model of

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
system lv2

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
for one part we set the type the part

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
ball is of type christmas tree ball

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
which is defined at the end it contains

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
the definition of an enumeration which

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
is then used to specify the attribute

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
color

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,799
so far all we have is a list of things

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
the diagram is therefore also just a

92
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
simple tree structure which of course

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
fits perfectly with our christmas tree

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
project

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
the graphical notation of system lb2 is

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
very similar to systemarry one one

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
difference in the diagram is the

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
relationship between the part ball and

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
the part definition christmas tree ball

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,159
the relationship with the two points is

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
defined by relationship

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
now we add some connections to our model

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
for example we use

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,000
simple connection relationships

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
and if we visualize the model we can see

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,959
the structure of our christmas tree

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
however since the visualization is

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
generated automatically we cannot adjust

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
the layout

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
so much for the 20-second door of imbc

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,000
podcast event calendar and we wish you a

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
great 22nd of december

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,520
bye
