00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
Welcome to the 22nd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,280
Today we travel to the future and model
our great MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,509
with the next generation
modeling language SysML v2

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,038
The SysML v2 is currently
under development

5
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:22,956
It will be officially available
probably in 2023 or 2024

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,700
So, there's still some time

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,578
however it is already interesting
to take a look at it now

8
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,736
in order to set the cost in good time

9
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:33,576
Two to three years is a very short
time in relation to major changes

10
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:37,000
in the process and tool
landscape in MBSE

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,630
The SysML Submission Team
SST for short is currently working

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,804
on the specification of SysML v2

13
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:47,672
What is great is that they also
provide a pilot implementation

14
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,120
So that you can experiment with SysML v2

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,029
We use the pilot implementation
based on Jupyter Lab

16
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:56,268
to show you some
more or less equivalent

17
00:00:56,268 --> 00:01:00,731
SysML v2 models of our Christmas tree

18
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,523
To avoid having to set up a Jupyter Lab
environment yourself

19
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:10,320
my company provides a ready-to-use
implementation at systemlv2lab.com

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
Here you will find a general
introduction to SysML v2

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,105
The current state of the
specification and many examples

22
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:20,200
You can also create your own
models and play around with them

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,327
But be aware from time to time
the server will be restarted

24
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,153
and all files will be lost

25
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:30,506
if you want to save your models
you have to download them manually

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,476
We have already uploaded
our Jupyter Notebook

27
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,079
for the MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree

28
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,470
SysML v2 offers a textual notation

29
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,040
in addition to the graphical notation
known from SysML v1

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
To create the models in
the pilot implementation

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,755
one has to use the textual notation

32
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:52,960
an then can generate the
graphical notation automatically

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,439
Later there will probably be graphical
editors for SysML v2 as well

34
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,190
So, let's have a look into
the Jupyter Lab

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,040
Our TMPCT model is a simplified version

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
of our SysML v1 Physical Architecture
of the Christmas tree

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,239
We have directly modeled the parts

38
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
They have no explicit type here

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,266
Simplified in SysML v1

40
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:20,000
it would mean to define part
properties without blocks

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
What works in SysML v2
but not in SysML v1

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,536
is that the parts can also
define structures themselves

43
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,748
as you can see here
for example with the tree

44
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,369
which defines the "trunk", the "branches"

45
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,754
and an attribute for
the "height" of the tree

46
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,890
If no type is defined however a type
from the system library of SysML v2

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,879
is implicitly set in the background

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
Also a part always needs a context

49
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,680
If this is not given as for example
with our top level part

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
"theMBSEPodcastChristmasTree"

51
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,734
then the element anything
from the kernel base library

52
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:02,800
is set as the context for the element

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,969
By the way, kernel is
the meta model of SysML v2

54
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
For one part, we set the type

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,000
The part "ball" is of type
"ChristmasTreeBall"

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,892
which is defined at the end

57
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:18,219
it contains the definition
of an enumeration

58
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,940
which is then used to
specify the attribute "color"

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,799
So far, all we have is a list of things

60
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,945
The diagram is therefore
also just a simple tree structure

61
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:34,880
which of course fits perfectly
with our Christmas tree project

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,940
The graphical notation of SysML v2 is
very similar to SysML v1

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,848
One difference in the diagram
is the relationship

64
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:45,680
between the part "ball" and
the part definition "ChristmasTreeBall"

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,369
the relationship with the two
points is defined by relationship

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
Now we add some connections to our model

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,515
For example, we use simple
connection relationships

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
And if we visualize the model, we can see
the structure of our Christmas tree

69
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,410
However since the visualization
is generated automatically

70
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,400
we cannot adjust the layout

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,917
So much for the 22nd door of
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

72
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:25,512
And we wish you a great 22nd of December

73
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:26,730
Bye-bye
