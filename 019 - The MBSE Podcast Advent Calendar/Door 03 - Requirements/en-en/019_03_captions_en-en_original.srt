00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,000
hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
behind the third door of our mbse

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,319
podcast advent calendar we take a quick

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,440
look at requirements modeling

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,280
there is and has been a lot to say about

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,040
requirements modelling we will limit

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,599
ourselves to one special feature which

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
is also the learning gift of today the

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
reuse of requirements

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
this is a bit unusual but is supported

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
by system l with a special relationship

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
and the relationship is not yet used

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
that often

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
in the christmas tree business there is

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,558
the important international christmas

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,399
tree standard abbreviated ics

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,079
the specific ics

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,840
2425-26-12 standard contains a list of

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,160
requirements for christmas trees we

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,039
import the standard to our model as a

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
model library

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
so let's have a look at our model

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
as an example the following table

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,680
contains

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,480
three of the christmas tree standards in

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
our library

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
so it's here in the library package and

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
here is the table

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
and they are for example

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
the tree shape now the shape of the tree

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
shall be complied with the ics standard

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
the three kinds the tree shall be a

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,439
third tree and the tree height the tree

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,920
shall be at least 150 centimeters and

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
maximum 200 centimeter high

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
our mbse podcast christmas tree project

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
would like to use exactly these

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
requirements from the library

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
however we would like to have a

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
different numbering schema and also add

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,840
additional properties like obligation

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,320
priority or the stakeholder

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,399
therefore we use the system a copy

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640
relationship to create copies of the

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
requirements in our model

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,640
we have here an example for the tree

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,079
which is located in the base

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
architecture

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
there's the tree and the requirement of

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,240
the tree and here is our

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
diagram

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,439
the requirement height of the tree is a

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,600
copy of the standard requirement tree

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,959
height

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
the relationship assures that the text

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
of the copied requirement is always

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
identical to the master

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
all other properties can be different

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
the following table shows some of our

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
mbse podcast christmas tree requirements

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
with the properties

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
id name text obligation priority

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
stakeholder and the master of the

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
requirement if it is a copy

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
so let's open the table it's here in the

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
requirements package

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
system requirements and here's the table

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
the requirements are in different

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
packages of the model some of them are

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
located in the package structure of the

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
related component for example here those

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,280
for the tree

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
so much for the third door of our mbse

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,000
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
a great third of december

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,159
goodbye

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,159
bye
