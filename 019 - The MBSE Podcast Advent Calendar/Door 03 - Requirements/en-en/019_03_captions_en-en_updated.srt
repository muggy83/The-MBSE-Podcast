Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,251
Behind the 3rd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:08,880
we take a quick look at
Requirements modeling

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,520
There is and has been a lot to say
about Requirements modelling

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,259
We will limit ourselves to
one special feature

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,920
which is also the learning gift of
today the reuse of Requirements

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
This is a bit unusual but is supported
by SysML with a special relationship

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,440
and the relationship is not
yet used that often

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,790
In the Christmas tree business

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:36,399
there is the important "International
Christmas Tree Standard" abbreviated "ICS"

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,657
The specific "ICS 242526-12" standard

12
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:43,580
contains a list of Requirements
for Christmas trees

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,486
We import the standard to our
model as a model library

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
So, let's have a look at our model

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
As an example the
following table contains

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,760
three of the Christmas Tree
Standards in our library

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,799
So, it's here in the library
package and here is the table

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
And they are for example

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
The "Tree Shape" shall be
complied with the "ICS" standard

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,909
The "Tree kinds" the tree shall be a
fir tree and the "Tree Height"

21
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,580
The tree shall be at least 150 centimeters
and maximum 200 centimeter high

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
Our MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree project

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,799
would like to use exactly these
Requirements from the library

24
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,650
However, we would like to have a
different numbering schema

25
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,030
And also add additional properties like
obligation, priority, or the stakeholder

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,159
Therefore we use the system
a copy relationship

27
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,399
to create copies of the
Requirements in our model

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,520
We have here an example for the tree
which is located in the Base Architecture

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,149
There's the tree and the Requirement of
the tree and here is our diagram

30
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,310
The Requirement height
of the tree is a copy

31
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,959
of the standard Requirement tree height

32
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,880
The relationship assures that the
text of the copied Requirement

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,309
is always identical to the master
all other properties can be different

34
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,160
The following table shows some of our
MBSE Podcast Christmas Tree Requirements

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
with the properties

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,428
ID, name, text, obligation
priority, stakeholder

37
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:33,840
and the master of the
Requirement if it is a copy

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,301
So, let's open the table
it's here in the requirements package

39
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:45,360
system Requirements and here's the table

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,838
The Requirements are in
different packages of the model

41
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:52,699
some of them are located in the package
structure of the related component

42
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:57,020
for example here those for the tree

43
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,257
So much for the 3rd door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

44
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:04,471
And we wish you a great 3rd of December

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,889
Goodbye

46
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,499
Bye-bye
