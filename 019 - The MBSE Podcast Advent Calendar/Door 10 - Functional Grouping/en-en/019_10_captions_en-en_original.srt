00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,879
welcome

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
behind the tenth store of our mbse

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,359
podcast advent calendar we take a look

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,679
at functional architectures

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
a functional architecture is a system

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
architecture based on functions and

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,519
independent of the physical entities

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,760
that implement the functions however the

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,119
functions can depend on physical

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
concepts defined in the base

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
architecture

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
the first method describes how to derive

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,359
the functional architecture from the use

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
case activities

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
the first main important step in the

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
first method is the grouping of the use

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
case activities

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
all the activities are grouped as a

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
decision of the system architect

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
the functional group itself is modeled

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,559
by a stereotype specializing in the

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,440
block

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
the grouping then is modeled by a trace

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
relationship from the functional group

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
to the activities

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
it is best to show and manage the

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,079
grouping in a matrix let's have a look

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,719
at it in the model

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
the functional groups and the matrix are

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,159
located in the functional architecture

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,240
package in our system model

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
the columns are the activities from the

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
use case analyzers

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
the rows are the functional groups

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
the single cells represent the presence

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,000
of a trace relationship

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
a special learning gift of today

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
sometimes it is easier to manage

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
relationships between model elements in

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
a matrix instead of showing them in a

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
diagram the following diagram shows the

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
same information as the matrix

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,799
so you can easily see that it is more

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,360
confusing

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
the next step is to derive the

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
functional architecture from the groups

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
we will have a look to this tomorrow

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
so much for the 10th store of our mbse

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
podcast advent calendar and we wish you

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,840
a great 10th of december bye bye

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
goodbye
