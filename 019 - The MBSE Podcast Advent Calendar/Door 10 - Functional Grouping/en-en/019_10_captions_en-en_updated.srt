Welcome

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,377
Behind the 10th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:09,309
We take a look at
Functional Architectures

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,339
A Functional Architecture is a system
architecture based on functions

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:16,953
and independent of the physical entities
that implement the functions

6
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:19,809
However the functions can
depend on physical concepts

7
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,960
defined in the Base Architecture

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,600
The FAS method describes how to
derive the Functional Architecture

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,909
from the Use Case Activities

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,300
The first main important step
in the FAS method is

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,040
the grouping of the Use Case Activities

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,990
All the activities are grouped as
a decision of the system architect

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
The Functional Group itself is modeled
by a stereotype specializing in the block

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,506
The grouping then is modeled
by a trace relationship

15
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,909
from the Functional Group
to the activities

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,380
It is best to show and manage
the grouping in a matrix

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,469
Let's have a look at it in the model

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
The Functional Groups and the matrix are

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,240
located in the Functional Architecture
package in our system model

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,159
The columns are the activities
from the use case analyses

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
The rows are the Functional Groups

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,560
The single cells represent the
presence of a trace relationship

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
A special learning gift of today

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,856
sometimes it is easier
to manage relationships

25
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:32,586
between model elements in a matrix

26
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:35,456
instead of showing
them in a diagram

27
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:41,060
the following diagram shows
the same information as the matrix

28
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,149
So, you can easily see
that it is more confusing

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,079
The next step is to derive the
Functional Architecture from the groups

30
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
We will have a look to this tomorrow

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,169
So much for the 10th door of our
MBSE Podcast Advent Calendar

32
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:05,030
And we wish you a great 10th of December

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,870
Bye-bye

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,710
Goodbye
