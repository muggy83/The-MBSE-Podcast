1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,839
okay so hello welcome

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,679
to a new episode of our mbse podcast

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,120
uh today we start our new series mbse in

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,240
the field and take a look

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
at how mbse is used in practice

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,680
our guest is from the company vender

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,920
lender

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,199
and well although you may have never

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
heard of the company

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
you have mostly likely worked with the

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,359
system either directly

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,359
or indirectly among other things

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,160
wonderland develops baggage handling

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,719
systems

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
for airports so and we are pleased to

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
have fatih akan

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
as our guest today and fatih please

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
introduce yourself

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
hi tim christian thanks for having me in

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,200
this uh

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,480
amazing nbsc podcast first of all

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,600
um my name is fatih arkhan

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,440
i work in architecture and strategy team

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,239
in bundo london

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,000
we are as a team defining the reference

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,840
architectures

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
and the design methods and the

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,119
guidelines for all of our business

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
segments

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,840
you can generalize our domain as

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
material handling systems in waldoland

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
recording in progress but also the the

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
warehousing

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,159
domain and the past domain

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
we delivered solutions to to our

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,200
customers which

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,600
are like hong kong airports heathrow

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,119
airports orlando amsterdam

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,280
istanbul airport amazon lidl

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,960
fedex ups dhl are also our customers

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,759
from warehousing and parcel business

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
so we are global leader in airports but

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
also a key player

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,840
in these other businesses

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,119
um i started to work for one london in

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,159
2017

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,439
as a solution architect in

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,439
airports business segment

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:09,840
and then we i also moved to this

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
new role last year

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,800
my bachelor and master degree is in

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,680
embedded software

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,879
and hardware engineering that was the

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
first five years of

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,920
my 15 years of engineering story and

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,879
later on i became a systems engineer in

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,319
the air defense and weapon systems

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,040
and in 2017 after

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
doing this weapon systems engineering

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
for

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
six years i moved to netherlands to work

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,560
for vandal under and

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,440
for the last four years basically i'm

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,879
i'm i'm doing this systems architecting

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,840
both for the projects

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,280
and also for the technology rnd side of

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,319
development

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,440
okay very cool cool experience

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,040
a good good kickstart for mbse

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,080
so could you give us a brief

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,840
motivation what was the

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,959
yeah the beginning of the journey the

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,480
nbc journey at vanderland and

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,879
when did it start how did it start

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,599
well i need to take it all the way from

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,640
the beginning

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
the foundation of the company is going

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,400
1949

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,040
and you might imagine the evolution of

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,599
the design was bottom-up like in other

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
words it was from mechanical to

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,720
electro-mechanical the

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,799
electro-mechanical to

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
embedded software first and then to

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
application software

86
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
and somewhere around 2000 2005 the

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,280
complexity became higher

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,280
and basically becomes a complex system

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
and then at that time the company

90
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,000
already started to invest on

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,920
having a stable requirements management

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,599
environment configuration management

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
change management

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,720
it was not just the military standards

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,120
like ocd sss ssd

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
but we also started to see some visual

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
drawings

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
which which was explaining the material

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,200
flow of diagrams which is really

100
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,720
critical in the logistic domain so all

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,239
of these things

102
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,799
try to be taken out of control in a in

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
a stable configuration management but

104
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,720
you can imagine

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
when when the systems are getting more

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,320
complex

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,440
and you can lose the traceability easily

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,360
and at the same time we were

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,520
forcing our um internal design to be

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
more platform-based like

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,680
creating reusable assets that that each

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,639
project can

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
can reuse what we are building and this

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,240
brings extra complexity

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,680
and somewhere in 2005 2010 we already

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
started to see that

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
it's it's getting more difficult to to

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
make

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,680
a reliable change impact analysis on the

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,919
things which are changing in your

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,440
technology domain on the customer's side

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,919
and that's why even actually before me

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
starting to work for this mbsc all the

124
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,520
way back in 2010

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
we started to see some uml models

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
appearing especially in the software

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
environment but

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,400
you can imagine the uml models are also

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
used to explain system level things

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
and at that time bond london was working

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,520
with ibm in certain projects so

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,720
that's why ibm rational draws what was

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
they appearing at that time

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,240
so when i look at the history i can

135
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,680
still see these type of models

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,919
in 2010 by the way 2010 they used

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,919
russian roles for indian projects

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,840
yeah there was again 2010 was still

139
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
a little bit influencing relationship

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,160
between ibm and wonderland

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,960
at that moment later on monday are

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,600
influenced by this and i started to

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,319
when i started to investigate backwards

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
i think 2013 is the year when i have

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
seen some

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
reference models appearing so some

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
people

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
already the people who are ready to

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
embrace the complexity and try to solve

150
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
it

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
started to create some uml models which

152
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,800
are really

153
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,800
depicting what we have

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,840
i even seen in 2015-16 when you look at

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,759
again the repositories create created

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,639
before you can even see some

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,039
automated interface creations like xst

158
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
files coming from these uml models

159
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,160
it was getting more and more

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
professional i should say

161
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
really more executable model instead of

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
just

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,600
knowledge gathering and sharing

164
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,360
but in all of these stories

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
there is there was a missing piece which

166
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,240
is a framework so

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
there was not a single way of creating

168
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,880
models

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,960
the modeling languages were not that

170
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,199
much

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,440
structured so there are several ways to

172
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,919
model with uml and csml

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,160
as you know so i tried to put this

174
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,039
missing piece into puzzle by trying to

175
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,160
create a framework and also a way of

176
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,440
working and the other missing piece

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,919
was basically uh

178
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,080
the models were never at the base so

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
they were always the supporting artifact

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
of the

181
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,160
of the main channel which is

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,160
documentation and that's why

183
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,400
we not just uh people before me but

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,319
it's always a common pattern that you

185
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
give up maintain the models if it's not

186
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
at the base of your thing

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
so that was also the missing piece in

188
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
the puzzle so

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
we were not i think one london was not

190
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,960
putting models at the base of the

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,280
of of the of the development of the

192
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,280
configuration management and etc so

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,400
these are basically the things i i put

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
on the frame

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,000
did you join wonderland to to create

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
this missing piece

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,720
was this that your first task the mbse

198
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,000
journey

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,120
well that was that that

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
uh that would be a different way but i

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
think

202
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
it was part of the story i was having

203
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
from

204
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,960
defense which you might imagine putting

205
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,440
a good foundation on your

206
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,639
systems engineering and model based

207
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,879
approach that's what

208
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,479
i have learned in my ex-employment in

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,360
turkey

210
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,880
and there was a certain reason i think i

211
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
started to work

212
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,839
here also they they need a structure

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
on the systems engineering not from the

214
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,000
documentation perspective also on the

215
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
model

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,720
based so i have been asked to

217
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,839
investigate this as a site task

218
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,120
i was doing the airports projects

219
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,440
like hong kong but at the same time

220
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,880
i was i was trying to understand how we

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920
can move

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,080
the complete apos design from document

223
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,519
based model based

224
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,800
and i i was basically taking this as a

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
kind of side track but

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,720
later on it became an official task for

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,279
me

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,480
and in the beginning i was trying to

229
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,760
apply this only for airports platform

230
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,320
airport platform business and then

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,000
airport platform and the business models

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,839
and then i was asked to apply this to

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,560
the whole business segments

234
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,480
try to create a framework applicable to

235
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,360
everything we do

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
as one london

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,040
okay and when you are talking about

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,800
foundation

239
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,800
and platforms what do you mean by that

240
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,080
well you can accept the

241
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
mbsc foundation as a light definition

242
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
for

243
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,920
the framework actually because when you

244
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
say that

245
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
hey i'm defining a framework for you it

246
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,519
can

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,680
create a heavy feeling on the other side

248
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
we call it mbsc foundation

249
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,279
so that's basically what we are trying

250
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
to create and

251
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
this framework is just having a meta

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
model

253
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
to explain people not just the content

254
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,720
but

255
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,040
the main structure of the models so a

256
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
kind of conformance guideline

257
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,079
also the way of working this is

258
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
basically what the mbsc foundation is

259
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,320
about

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,279
and the platform so

261
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
these are different things right the

262
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,560
mbse foundation is more the

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,959
the methodology and the platform is

264
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
your product itself right yeah the

265
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,360
platform is is

266
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
you can accept platform as a system with

267
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
its

268
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
own architecture and product line so it

269
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,519
is

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
similar to product design not completely

271
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,000
but

272
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,040
because it is a system architecture and

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
we

274
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
platforms are basically not necessarily

275
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
they don't need to be model based of

276
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,200
course our platforms are just reusable

277
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,720
asset repositories

278
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,959
in each business segment so that each

279
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,600
project can be instantiated from this

280
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,320
reusable asset repository you don't need

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,839
to

282
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
start from scratch all of your

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
functional decomposition structural

284
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,519
decomposition

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
you just need to pick what you need we

286
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
are nowadays calling

287
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,320
configure to order business instead of

288
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
engineer to order

289
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,880
so that's what the platforms are about

290
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
so that means you have this platform

291
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
approach really from

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,839
the requirements or at least from a

293
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
functional

294
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
layer uh throughout your bombs in the

295
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,519
end

296
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,760
yes that's true that's foreign

297
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
technology environment like you are

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
trying to generalize

299
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,200
requirements or features which can cover

300
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
the market

301
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,519
and then your reusable asset repository

302
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
should be covering as much as possible

303
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
so that

304
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,600
you don't need to reinvent things for

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
each customer specific things

306
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,200
well how does it work well

307
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,880
that's that's a dream for many

308
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
organizations to have something like

309
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
that a

310
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
working product line in the mbse

311
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,639
environment so

312
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
how does it work indeed it's

313
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,880
very challenging and i would be really

314
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,040
happy when it really works

315
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,279
we are really working hard to make it

316
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,279
work

317
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,839
and having a platform in its own

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
environment is a challenging task but

319
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,040
applying an mbac to this which is

320
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,160
actually our topic today is an extra

321
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,680
challenge because from what i

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
what i've learned before and what i'm

323
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,040
studying and also applying

324
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
doing mbs for a project can be a little

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
bit better like focusing on a certain

326
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
customer requirement and applying

327
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
this decomposition according to the

328
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
needs is fine but when you try to apply

329
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
it for

330
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,399
platforms you need to create a reusable

331
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,240
asset repository for your models

332
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,600
so that so that each project can reuse

333
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
your your platform models

334
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,920
what what we are working on nowadays

335
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,480
is to to define

336
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
the core parts which is not changing per

337
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,880
project

338
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,320
and the variable part explicitly so that

339
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,160
you can at least work on work on the

340
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,240
variety model in a different way than

341
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,360
the core modeling so core modeling can

342
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
still work

343
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
with main artifacts which is a little

344
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
bit a little bit more straightforward i

345
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
should say when it comes to the right

346
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
model

347
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,680
you need to do different stuff but also

348
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
we are trying to simplify things for

349
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,760
projects

350
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,839
such as if you have a model for your

351
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,279
uh core part and even for the variant

352
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,600
part which is

353
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,720
not specified for customers so you have

354
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
it already

355
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,199
you don't need to ask your projects to

356
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
to be dealt with models

357
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,680
they just need to configure what you

358
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,519
have but at least they can focus on the

359
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,839
customer specific part so

360
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,199
they can spend their time to create

361
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,560
models for customer specific parts

362
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,240
but to be ready applying this we we try

363
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,519
to

364
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,680
introduce a data connection from the

365
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
models to a web-based application like

366
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,680
you can

367
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,959
use the data of the model instead of

368
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,279
trying to

369
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,120
understand the models which you already

370
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,880
have in your product line

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
because the models for the platform is

372
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
only for the product line

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,800
and that's a communication pattern as a

374
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,680
communication channel you need to do in

375
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,519
your development

376
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,360
environment but when it comes to deploy

377
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,320
some customer solution

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,839
you don't need to expose your models to

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,880
the customer environment that's

380
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,639
basically

381
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,880
one of the most important stuff we are

382
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,880
trying to implement

383
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:05,519
um for for the for the other

384
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,959
for for the other aspect of it um

385
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,800
so we want solution teams to spend more

386
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
time on the customer specific part but

387
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,880
that means we have a big task in the rnd

388
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,920
environment to really make

389
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,920
the change impact analysis consistent

390
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
and also the models which are being

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,279
created by different teams are not

392
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
looking very different from each other

393
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,320
that's where that's where this

394
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,639
meta model comes into place in other

395
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,440
words metamodels should also show

396
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,320
your core and their right parts

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,199
separated from each other

398
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
that's that's basically um that's

399
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,440
basically what we are

400
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,120
spending time on to to really apply

401
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
product line engineering on an mbsc

402
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
environment

403
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,560
um maybe for this one tim

404
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,279
maybe make it more tangible i can i can

405
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,600
show the platform and the project

406
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,880
connection a little bit better to you

407
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,519
by some by some slides if you like

408
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,959
yeah that's a good idea but please

409
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,120
explain the slice so that

410
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,560
our pure audio listeners also understand

411
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,279
it

412
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,279
that would be great

413
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,680
i hope it's visible it is

414
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,279
yeah so

415
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,279
the platform is basically

416
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,680
as you can see at the bottom of our

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,560
picture it's a kind of

418
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,440
reusable asset repository again which

419
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
can be

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,639
instantiated for different customer

421
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
projects

422
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
and as you can see in the middle of

423
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,920
picture we have

424
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,519
a reality which is a kind of airports

425
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
this is the heathrow project at the back

426
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
end and on top of it you see the

427
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,000
customer solution model

428
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
that's really what you are deploying

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
but this this model of course does not

430
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,360
mean too much

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
for the stakeholders if not if you are

432
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,559
not creating views

433
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,160
and you need to be able to create

434
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
different views and these different

435
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
views

436
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
as you can imagine in the in for

437
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,079
instance csm like csml pillars like you

438
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,079
have a

439
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:24,480
behavior view you have a structure

440
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:28,079
you might have also customer specific

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,840
views like the layout like our 3d

442
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,640
environment involved which is very

443
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,320
important how the

444
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
how the mechanical equipment is really

445
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
fitting into building that you need to

446
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,679
show

447
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
so if you speak about models you do not

448
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,280
only mean system

449
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
models mbs e-modules in general so

450
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,520
including

451
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,240
cat models and whatever models okay

452
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,280
well you see you see in the in this

453
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
diagonal

454
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,360
you see the the software structure and

455
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,000
the function capabilities we've already

456
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,679
you can cover them easily with the very

457
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,600
well known aspects of csml and uml

458
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,160
when it comes to this logistic view for

459
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
instance like the material flow diagram

460
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
you might need to switch to domain

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,799
specific languages which we are for

462
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
instance looking at

463
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,120
and as you mentioned when it comes to

464
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
mechanical it's the cad model

465
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
but this this weave is also interesting

466
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,840
if you look at the right hand side

467
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,720
you see a configuration view point

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,039
that's basically how we want to set so

469
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
if you can emit the data

470
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
of your configurability in a certain way

471
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
in a customer meeting

472
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
what we are saying this is a configure

473
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
to order business that's that's how you

474
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,720
can execute

475
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,120
this platform model for a certain

476
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,840
customer starting from sales

477
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,520
till the end of deployment that's what

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,280
we are also trying to put in the context

479
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,960
and the other wheel you see on the left

480
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
is the documentation

481
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,760
so it's always the topic in mbse are you

482
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,320
able to create documents out of

483
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,240
models that's what we want to do if it's

484
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,400
if it's hundred percent

485
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
uh coming from what you have done before

486
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
you should be writing the text again and

487
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,440
again

488
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,120
that's what basically we are saying so

489
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,120
this is all in this

490
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,480
image in a nutshell same system

491
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,160
mean different things for different

492
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
stakeholders and you need to really

493
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
understand all these views by

494
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,640
communicating with your stakeholders

495
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,200
that's what we are doing

496
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,520
furthermore you haven't seen the meta

497
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,320
model in this discussion yet because

498
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,120
your meta model should be aiming

499
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,160
different businesses so in this slide

500
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,320
you see a platform model warehousing

501
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,160
platform model and the parcel platform

502
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,120
model

503
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
to we are aiming these things to work in

504
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,799
the same way

505
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,600
at least on the model-based environment

506
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
that's why

507
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,080
you need to be able to create a common

508
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
guideline

509
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
at the bottom that's showing the

510
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,280
relationship between each classes

511
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,799
each blocks so what type of

512
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
things you can have in this model i

513
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,280
think the theoretical definition for

514
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,520
this is taxonomy of your model

515
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
and a part of its ontology so we are

516
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,919
trying to

517
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,159
merge this theoretical discussions like

518
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
metamodel ontology and taxonomy in a

519
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,720
single thing called metamodel

520
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
and we even call it mbsc foundation to

521
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,320
make it even simpler for

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
the company so that's what you see on

523
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,960
these slides

524
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,799
okay uh yeah if i look at this that's

525
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
for example for for the airport it looks

526
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
like

527
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,679
in the center you show a solution model

528
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,919
and around i can see the different views

529
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,840
like the layout view of the airport

530
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,039
or the software view or the functional

531
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,320
views and so on

532
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,039
but in the middle the solution model is

533
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,679
physically these are several models

534
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
right

535
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,799
it's it's a cat model and it's a system

536
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,480
model and so on

537
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,919
uh so logical it's a single solution

538
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,320
model but physically you have

539
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,360
several models exactly how do you

540
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
connect these

541
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
models well that's one of the big

542
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
challenges today

543
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,120
yeah for many companies how to connect

544
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,679
different models so this model

545
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,960
interoperability how does it work

546
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,960
well in our case

547
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,480
a little bit i think we can

548
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,960
we will talk about more details on the

549
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,679
tool suite challenges i guess here but

550
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,440
yet at least the interoperability now

551
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,559
we're not that much

552
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,880
in good shape yet so we are still

553
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,840
using our existing tools like sparks

554
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,720
enterprise architect

555
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,120
we are using csml and the magic grid

556
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,880
framework which explains

557
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,280
how you should make this metamodel but

558
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,120
when it comes to really realize it

559
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,760
with this interoperability we are

560
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,080
hitting the boundaries of our existing

561
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,240
ict architecture in this story of course

562
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,720
we are working on some gateways like

563
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,799
showing the proof of concepts

564
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
like trying to connect at least requires

565
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,720
management to

566
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,080
to to the modeling environment to really

567
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
be able to create documents

568
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,440
automatically

569
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
maybe some some synchronization between

570
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,880
these environments

571
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,000
when it comes to cad models and etc we

572
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,120
need to think

573
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
within the platform world and good bits

574
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,720
because as i said we have some domain

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,559
specific languages already in place

576
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,440
it's really difficult to call them

577
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,520
officially the dsls but

578
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
as an organization you already have them

579
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,919
so there are rules

580
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,240
in these mechanical models we are we are

581
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,360
now

582
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,679
for instance running a project with tno

583
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,480
esi here in netherlands just to focus on

584
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,320
the relationship between these models

585
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,480
and the plm environment product line

586
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,360
management like in innovia

587
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,440
and in our layout environment for

588
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,720
instance

589
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,679
the transformations i think we

590
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
we will be creating some gateways but at

591
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,559
the same time while

592
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,799
showing the necessities of this stuff

593
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,880
with with the ict people in our company

594
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,799
we are looking for different two suites

595
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
which are really showing these

596
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,400
dependencies immediately like

597
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,799
synchronized way

598
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
but for now our transformations are

599
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,919
really

600
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:24,159
um we are still too much

601
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,880
optimizing the well-known

602
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,960
model artifacts like the functions and

603
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
structural view

604
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
the challenge is a little bit the

605
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
configurations view but we are still

606
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,679
modeling this in the sparks enterprise

607
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,799
architect so in a nutshell

608
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,039
still the models are in a kind of

609
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,640
single tool island but we are trying to

610
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,240
connect them to the others as much as

611
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,240
possible that's what we are working on

612
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,360
okay and then imagine that you are also

613
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
doing

614
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,520
model based product line engineering

615
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,120
um which is a challenging thing for

616
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,080
itself

617
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,159
so what kind of technologies do you use

618
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,880
in this direction

619
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:15,679
yeah let me stop sharing and then

620
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,320
this this product line engineering

621
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,080
we we can call our platforms as a

622
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,159
product line engineering plus more

623
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,679
so it's not completely a product line

624
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
because we are not just selling

625
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,640
single products they are really working

626
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,159
together there is an architecture and

627
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
etc

628
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,679
and meaning that we have a bigger

629
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,600
challenge but at least just for this

630
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,279
product line part

631
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,919
for the variety management we

632
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,120
we started to investigate some

633
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,559
extensions to the existing csml

634
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,000
as i said we are using xml mostly 1.55

635
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,960
waiting for 2.0 to be also

636
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
more solidified because i know very well

637
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
the right

638
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,200
management is more explicit there what

639
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
we are trying

640
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,120
what we are trying to do is looking at

641
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,360
some

642
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,000
existing extensions like vamos for

643
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,200
instance from them

644
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,200
try to apply it in our project

645
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,200
but at the same time we have been

646
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,880
realizing

647
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,960
the variety trees are not that much

648
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,799
difficult to model even with the

649
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,840
existing xml blocks

650
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,120
but when it comes to model

651
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,120
the constraints the rules

652
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,039
and to really execute them for

653
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,320
verification validation and for

654
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:39,279
sending purposes or your product line

655
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,159
we have a challenge there that's where

656
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,640
we are looking at

657
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,640
for some transformation like maybe

658
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,120
modeling the rules

659
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,559
in a little bit more domain specific

660
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,279
language environment

661
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,760
where we can make some xml connection

662
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,360
between the sparks environment and

663
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,360
the other rule based

664
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,640
modeling environment so that's that's

665
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,760
basically

666
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,440
uh one of the things

667
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,200
we are doing the pure variance

668
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
we are looking we are also looking at

669
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,159
this orthogonal variety

670
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,159
modeling is another

671
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,919
method from vm

672
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,279
so all of all of these things are in our

673
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
concentration that's a very

674
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,480
good good moment to speak about this

675
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,440
because we are really running this

676
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,159
project with tn or esi right now

677
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,720
and i think at the end of this project

678
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,520
somewhere in june

679
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,440
we are finishing it in july or august

680
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,360
you might see an article coming from our

681
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,640
side on our learnings on this variety

682
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,039
modeling

683
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,960
moving the how it will it can be applied

684
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,799
in an automated logistics domain

685
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
so that will be writing the title of the

686
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,440
article

687
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,720
oh cool it reminds me that we have to

688
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,279
have two more episodes one on vamos and

689
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,159
one we have to invite danilo boyce from

690
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,159
pure systems

691
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
will be interesting also and i i've

692
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,640
currently a project where we combine

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,840
both

694
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,880
which are perfectly fits together

695
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,640
with farmers you can model variability

696
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,159
and you can model the the features and

697
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
the feature constraints now if you

698
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,399
select this feature you must also

699
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,159
select that one etc but you can also

700
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,039
extract the feature modeling to appear

701
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,600
variants

702
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,440
which makes sense if it's not only about

703
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,279
system l

704
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,520
the feature model should also impact

705
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,000
other models not only the system model

706
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
oh yeah

707
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
but the modeling of the variability in

708
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,720
the system um

709
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,360
can still be done with uh with the

710
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
vehemence approach

711
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,880
the dsl discussions a little bit we have

712
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,640
some complexities like

713
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,200
very very complicated rules just

714
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
sometimes need some dsl extension that's

715
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
also

716
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,960
a very interesting learning for us on

717
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,080
the way

718
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,320
yeah okay so

719
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,200
well yeah you do a lot of sophisticated

720
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,559
mbse stuff i would say

721
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,600
so and what do you think are

722
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,600
the main organizational challenges in

723
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,600
adapting mbsc so one part is the

724
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,000
technical challenges but what are about

725
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
the organizational challenges yeah

726
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
that's the

727
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,440
that's the bitter sweet part

728
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,320
of the meal now so acceptance and

729
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,480
ownership

730
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
that might sound cliche i think i see

731
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,000
this answer as a copy paste

732
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
in many contexts especially if you're

733
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
trying to embed this

734
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,720
on a wider scope and if you have someone

735
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,159
it's possible to do that

736
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,159
i think that's that's still the biggest

737
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,640
challenge um i need to maybe

738
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,799
i need to go back to what i did before

739
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,080
like as i explained in airports i tried

740
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,279
to do that

741
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,200
as a side track and i was trying to use

742
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,799
it in the project and showing the value

743
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
immediately

744
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,960
at the same time having meetings with

745
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,480
with many stakeholders and

746
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,640
i i was not the domain senior

747
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
meaning that i was i need i needed to

748
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,120
find senior architects

749
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,919
knowing the domain also can understand

750
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,159
what ccmet and uml means i should say

751
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,480
and and not running away when i call

752
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,520
something called metamodel

753
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,200
if it's too theoretical let's say and

754
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,799
also some executive leaders of course

755
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,919
you need to find

756
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,200
some some budget owners some sponsors i

757
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
was mostly aiming

758
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,279
that part saying that if i if i had

759
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,720
these green lights

760
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,200
then we can go but i think that was not

761
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,200
the

762
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
whole story so acceptance and ownership

763
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,640
is really running in the teams

764
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,320
so you cannot really understand your

765
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
acceptance and ownership by just looking

766
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,760
at the organizational chart so you need

767
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,760
to look at

768
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,080
who is struggling about this document

769
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,919
creation who is struggling about

770
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,360
doing some certain stuff and maybe they

771
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
don't need model they need something

772
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
else and

773
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,399
you really need to hear these stories

774
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,919
first to understand

775
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,320
the level of details in your models

776
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
but also they need to be involved from

777
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
day one

778
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,960
i mean if you go there with the complete

779
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,799
story

780
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
there's not much room for improvement

781
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,919
and you're just staying with your great

782
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,120
models i mean

783
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,880
it's really like the ivory tower

784
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,120
behavior happening also on the nbsc

785
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,919
that's not only for nbc you can imagine

786
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,360
in all kinds of transformation and what

787
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,720
i did now for instance in this new task

788
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,080
i tried to get all stakeholders involved

789
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,679
as much as possible from day one so that

790
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,440
they can define the metamodel

791
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,679
so it's a kind of language you need to

792
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
create all together so everyone needs to

793
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,080
understand the same thing

794
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,799
from a function and the function can be

795
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
written in

796
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,080
100 different ways in all systems

797
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,240
engineering books

798
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,919
even in csml you can say i have a

799
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
function but there is a property which

800
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,240
makes it non-functional you

801
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,039
you really need to align on this stuff

802
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,000
from day one so that they can feel that

803
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,120
that's also their

804
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,559
own thing so that they can all so that's

805
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,960
basically

806
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,760
would be my message to everyone when it

807
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,120
comes to

808
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,240
they face the same challenge on

809
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,240
acceptance and ownership

810
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,679
all right so one

811
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,519
question so that uh do you translate

812
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,240
your your meta model or your

813
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,159
your language your mbse language into

814
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,720
the models meaning that you

815
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,159
do not use for the system l term for

816
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
example activity

817
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
but instead use your term for that and

818
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
uh by using

819
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,960
stereotypes and name it and function or

820
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,320
whatever yeah

821
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,240
that's where this story went a little

822
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,519
bit theoretical for our team but thanks

823
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,799
for asking

824
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,519
because actually that's what we are

825
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,720
doing

826
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,159
so we are somehow tuning some names like

827
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,799
you know we don't call it uh

828
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,440
a function but we call the capability so

829
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,120
that's

830
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,880
so that that's that's maybe more

831
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,240
resonating with the company but when it

832
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,120
comes to

833
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,880
certain diagram artifacts we are not

834
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,840
hiding the fact that we are using use

835
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
case modeling

836
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
they are use cases

837
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,600
but people are just understanding hey we

838
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,960
have a capability model here

839
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,799
so they don't need to understand what

840
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,600
the use case is

841
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,240
but it's not a very formal method model

842
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
meaning that

843
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,600
there is another toolbox that you can

844
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,720
drag and drop different

845
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,279
artifacts like a profile it's not there

846
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,640
yet

847
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,320
although i'm thinking about it how

848
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,799
we are deploying this method model now

849
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,799
is just a little bit knowledge model

850
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,360
i should say and then we are creating

851
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,640
the platform models for each business

852
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
segment

853
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,279
that they look exactly the same how the

854
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,679
metamodel looks like

855
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,440
they have the same relationship between

856
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
all of their packages and classes and

857
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,519
even views

858
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,279
and then they can always look back how

859
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,799
the metamodel looks like

860
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,120
but the relationship between these

861
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,320
elements are not

862
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,320
automatically transferred to each other

863
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,360
but in time after a while after a solid

864
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,480
metamodel team we are planning to

865
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,600
create a verification template like you

866
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,600
can

867
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,840
compile your platform model saying that

868
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,919
okay you are still in the meta model

869
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,559
or you have some relationship which

870
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,200
doesn't make sense for the metamodel

871
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,519
that's also what i plan to do in future

872
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,519
okay

873
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,519
cool yeah but i'm still interested in

874
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,519
those

875
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
acceptance and ownership things i i

876
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
guess this is much

877
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,720
more the problem than finding the right

878
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,840
tool chain or something like that

879
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,600
yeah that's true i mean there is

880
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,000
one trap for instance we have found

881
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,159
ourselves recently

882
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,760
it was a little bit similar question and

883
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,240
answer that just happened between team

884
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,240
and me so when you

885
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
when you when you are really enjoying

886
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,159
modeling when you are enjoying when you

887
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,720
know the mbscs similar

888
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
uml that can also stay very theoretical

889
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,599
for

890
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,200
the organization you can say hey we have

891
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,320
a nice language here

892
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,760
we created this meta model together

893
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,760
but you should be able to create very

894
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,200
quick proof of concepts

895
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,320
like really maybe documented as part of

896
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,119
the baseline

897
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,480
or creating some software for them they

898
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,079
can drag and drop

899
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,679
a block and the interface is

900
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,359
automatically appearing

901
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,800
so if you are not able to show this very

902
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,520
quickly

903
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,000
you can also find a trap find yourself

904
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,839
in the trap that i have found so

905
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,320
i i've heard a lot of criticism for

906
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,560
instance like it's too theoretical so

907
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,839
we need a phd to understand this abs

908
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,520
influence these type of things are also

909
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,960
something that's right now happening for

910
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,280
instance that's

911
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,599
why we started to deploy some proof of

912
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,400
concepts very quickly so

913
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,040
i already started to see some teams are

914
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,320
taking it

915
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,880
as as part of their daily job

916
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,240
so we have some acceptance but the

917
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,920
ownership is also like

918
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,240
the validation of the systems you need

919
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
to wait one year to see that they are

920
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,720
really maintained

921
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,040
so i think maybe

922
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,119
in another episode after a year we can

923
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,880
close the loop saying that hey

924
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,000
the ownership is there but i'm still

925
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,960
hopeful that that

926
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,480
that we will really uh overcome this

927
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,880
acceptance of ownership

928
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
challenge

929
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,880
uh i think the well another part side of

930
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,720
the coin

931
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,839
of acceptance is the right tool

932
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,800
um you could have a very good

933
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,680
methodology and concepts etc etc but if

934
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
you don't have

935
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
the tool then it does not work in

936
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,480
practice or it's not

937
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,359
not very effective to do that so um and

938
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,839
you mentioned that this

939
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,920
is another organizational challenge so

940
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,839
what what exactly do you mean

941
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
by that challenge in your context

942
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,320
actually it's the kind of cliche from

943
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,440
time to time when you say hey the right

944
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,079
tool suites are

945
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
very important because i've been hearing

946
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,280
more and more

947
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,720
hey the tools are coming later first

948
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,920
define your

949
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,680
methodology define what you need but

950
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,119
especially looking at

951
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,720
my previous answer like you need to be

952
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,760
able to show the proof of concept as

953
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,000
quick as possible to be able to do that

954
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,920
you need to write connection with your

955
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,760
existing structure

956
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,119
the reason why i'm saying the existing

957
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,880
structure

958
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,320
if you are not creating systems

959
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,240
engineering as a green field

960
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
in your company if you have something

961
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,520
already in place

962
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,720
probably you have systems engineers who

963
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
know

964
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,400
how things work they know how doors

965
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,160
can be used for requirements management

966
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,480
in the traceability

967
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,240
things are in place it might work it

968
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,200
might not work as well you might have

969
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,280
some

970
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,480
personal view on this topic it should be

971
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,720
improved

972
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,760
but this is a stable environment if you

973
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,560
somehow show

974
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,720
just the side track without being able

975
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,720
to synchronize

976
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,760
the current channel and your side

977
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,240
channel

978
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
you will never be able to show the proof

979
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,119
of concept values

980
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,320
as as big as you think because that's

981
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,640
not an added value

982
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,000
so you are bringing something but at the

983
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,160
same time you are taking

984
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,079
something out of the box it's a kind of

985
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,800
chicken and egg scenario so

986
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,520
you don't have the right tool suite in

987
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,520
place

988
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
because you have a vision first and

989
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,640
before having the right tool suite

990
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,160
you believe that you're not able to show

991
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,320
the real value as you are imagining and

992
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,320
that's why i think the solution to that

993
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,240
at least what we are doing is

994
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,920
without explaining the details to people

995
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,119
what you are doing just try to connect

996
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,720
with gateways

997
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,040
like it can be bi-directional it can be

998
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,480
just export imports like what we are

999
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,680
doing in the variety management

1000
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,839
maybe and then you can say that if i

1001
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,359
have a full synchronization here

1002
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,320
like in this tool suite it will be 100

1003
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,560
better so just give me this tool suite

1004
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,800
so that i can go that way so that's what

1005
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
basically we are doing in wanda london

1006
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,079
which is really profit based and you

1007
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,800
should always show the value

1008
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
to be invested in so that would be my

1009
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,800
answer to this

1010
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,640
two suite challenge question

1011
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,119
yeah was definitely very interesting to

1012
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,320
see what's what's going on in the field

1013
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,520
and um yeah so our

1014
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,560
our time is more or less already over

1015
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
okay so thank you very much fadi for

1016
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,880
your insights

1017
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,320
and your openness talking about your

1018
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,000
approaches i hope people can learn from

1019
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,760
it

1020
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,480
