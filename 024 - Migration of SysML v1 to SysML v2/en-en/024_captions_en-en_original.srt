00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:25,339
[Music]

3
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:04,159
[Music]

4
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,489
so

5
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,410
[Music]

6
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,490

8
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
welcome to the next episode of the mbse

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
podcast

10
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
yeah today there are only two people on

11
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
the screen so that's because tim is my

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
guest today and we will talk about let's

13
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
say a hot system l2 topic for all the

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
sysml1 practitioners

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
so if you are already using suseml1 you

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
might have the question what happens

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
when sml 2 comes up and can i go on

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
using my ssmlv1 models and

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
can can i translate them can i translate

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
them back maybe and that's what we want

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
to talk today with

22
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,758
tim

23
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,080
yeah and as you might might know tim and

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,400
i we are both

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
members of the system submission team

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,599
and tim has also a track lead and it's

27
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,400
exactly the track lead which

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
which thinks and uh yeah it handles the

29
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,120
topic of

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,200
the system l v2 or 1 2v2 transformation

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
so tim

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
how how did you become direct lead

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,599
of this track

34
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,040
and the first work i think began in 2014

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
or so if i remember it correctly

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000
uh

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
we had a podcast about it uh about the

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
history of system i think it was the

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
first second one right correct correct

40
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
but it wasn't german i think no i don't

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
know

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
well in any case it's been a very long

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
time uh so when the system lb2

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
submission team was officially set up

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
after the the omg published the request

46
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,080
for proposal the rfp for system will be

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,040
2 in

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,599
2017

49
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,080
um it was quite apparent that the chairs

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
of the system lv1 would also work on the

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
transformation

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
so even i became the track lead so i'm

53
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
not the only triplet uh even i are the

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
track leads for the transformation and

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
well which is named track number three

56
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
okay so that means that the necessity

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
necessity or for model transformation or

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
translation or whatever it is we will

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
talk about this later on um was

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
identified very early and it

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,959
was

62
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
a mandatory requirement i guess in the

63
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,479
system lv2

64
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,280
right

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
yeah right yeah so the the system lv2

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
rfp is a list of requirements for system

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
lv2

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
um and to be precise there's a

69
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
requirement to develop a system lv2

70
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,280
profile for uml

71
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
and that requirement also says that

72
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,639
an equivalent function capability can be

73
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,520
demonstrated by mapping the uml meter

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
classes and the system stereotypes

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
between system lv2 and v1 so in short by

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
a system we want to v2 transformation

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
so

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
well that that was the starting point

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
and we started with the development of

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
the smart v2 profile in 2017 so

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
five years ago um

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,919
but that's uh

83
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
the the system lv2 profile for uml or

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,919
yes you mean track four ah okay yeah

85
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,880
yeah uh track three so it's uh

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
well like the smelly one it's a uml

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
profile it was the idea to develop as a

88
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
small v2 profile of course it's it's

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,440
only a subset of this as well v2

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
um

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
so yeah we started with that and well it

92
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,919
was not very easy

93
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,960
uh because this isn't uh we too abstract

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
syntax

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
so the the data structure of the

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
elements is quite different from system

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
lv1

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
so we had to do some

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
well very

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,039
terrible twisting to define this is

101
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,919
maybe two elements as stereotypes of um

102
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,039
and

103
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
um

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
well that would have been a very huge

105
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
task for the tools to present these

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
strange

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
stereotypes to the user so that the user

108
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,759
can really work with it so

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
yeah that was

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
a big challenge that time and well

111
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
and on the other side we might have been

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
able to turn well a few blind eyes and

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
for example just rename the system uh

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
we won block to part definition and

115
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,280
versus maybe two profiler which is

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
roughly the equivalent this is maybe two

117
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
part definition and block

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
um

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
but then we we would mix up the

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
terminology well so the the content

121
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
concepts are similar but they're not the

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
same and it would be fuzzy to call

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
something part definition which it

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
actually is not so

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
yeah

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
so in retrospect i would say that

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,599
developing this maybe two profiles

128
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,520
it's not reasonable possible to do that

129
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
and another problem is we we had very

130
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,639
few resources for the development

131
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
uh and at that time there

132
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
uh well only the two of us and the

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,639
transformation was still on our to-do

134
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
list so

135
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
i think it was about two years or three

136
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,960
years ago

137
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
that we decided to concentrate only on

138
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
the transformation then

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
okay and that that means that

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
nowadays there are more than you two

141
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
guys

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
no

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
it's it's basically just if and me um

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
working in track free um

145
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,520
and well both of us have a full-time job

146
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,240
which

147
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
we earn our money um so

148
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
yeah it's uh the lack of resources is a

149
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
big problem

150
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,879
from time to time we get some help from

151
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,800
others so for example in our weekly

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
telecons um typically ed joins us at

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,199
side of this

154
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
uh and helps us with some questions we

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
have about the system i'll be two meter

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,759
model no yeah okay

157
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,599
okay very interesting how this this

158
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,240
stuff is organized but uh let's go a

159
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,479
little bit in in on the technical

160
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
background now so

161
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
what's behind this v12v2 transformation

162
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
yeah so the the official delivery of our

163
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319
work is quite boring

164
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,240
it's uh it's a transformation

165
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
specification which means paperwork no

166
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
it's it's a pdf

167
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
which is finally a part of the standard

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
uh but but we also develop a pilot

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
implementation of the transformation so

170
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,559
it's not the system will be two part

171
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,039
implementation it's it's another one

172
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,440
implementation of the transformation

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
because otherwise it won't be possible

174
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
to verify it no

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,120
these complex rules of mappings and etc

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
so we need to to test it

177
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
um so well the challenge was then how to

178
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
do that and in general how to do that

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
and of course uh with the lack of

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,839
resources we have

181
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
is

182
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
to develop

183
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
to software engineering stuff and so on

184
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
so our solution um

185
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,279
is

186
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
a tool chain

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
so we we specify the transformation

188
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,240
in a class model

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
uh with ocl constraints

190
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
and we use the cameo systems modeler

191
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
tool and the chamber cloud server for

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
that so

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,080
um

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
so thanks to the soul

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
for supporting this this will be to work

196
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,560
they also support the other teams with

197
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,360
their tools very helpful

198
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
and with openmbe

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,360
um

200
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
we completely generate then the

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
specification pdf document uh from this

202
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
model um

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
and by the way the complete system maybe

204
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
two specifications generated with

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,360
openmbe

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
and our our transformation is

207
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
only an nx

208
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,040
in one of the documents

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
a couple of episodes ago we had

210
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079
christelle from laserjpl as i uh and he

211
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:04,880
talked

212
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
about openmbe yeah and i think we also

213
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
talked about the doctrine mechanism yeah

214
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,880
right

215
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
yeah so um well that's the toolchain how

216
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
we define the transformation and create

217
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,440
the the document

218
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,320
uh well it's pure model based um

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
and we use the same model

220
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,279
um

221
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,040
to which we use to generate the

222
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
specification document to generate the

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
the code for the pilot implementation

224
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
okay and

225
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,440
so first we we export the model to xmi

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
to get access to it

227
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
in eclipse

228
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
eclipse cannot directly access the

229
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
timber cloud server and so on and then

230
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
we use the the eclipse

231
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
epsilon technology

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
these are java based

233
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,839
uh scripts for um

234
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
for model engineering tasks

235
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
and we use epsilon to generate uh atl

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
code from the transformation model

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
and atl stands for atlas transformation

238
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,120
language uh which is used for

239
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,560
model-to-model transformation that's

240
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,519
it's a

241
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,440
framework to do that so and we create

242
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,399
100

243
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,120
of the atl code so it's not necessary to

244
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,160
do any

245
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,680
manual updates um so we export

246
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,560
from

247
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,399
from from cameo to xmi and then uh we

248
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
click a button to generate the atl and

249
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
then

250
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
that's it well then we can run the atl

251
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
code to transform this maybe one models

252
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
to assist my region

253
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
okay and did you already try to

254
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
to do it also from let's say an

255
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
enterprise architect or rhapsody xmi

256
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,680
so would would this work in theory and

257
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,160
in practice

258
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
um

259
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
well in theory it works

260
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
because the input format of our

261
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,000
transformation is xmi and which is an

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
omg standard so if the modeling tool

263
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,079
like enterprise architect or rhapsody

264
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,279
can export the model to uh xmi which is

265
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
conformed with the standard

266
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
and we can use it as an input for

267
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,959
transformation um

268
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,639
yeah yeah we have not tried that um

269
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,240
because we we don't need it enough for

270
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
our work and well again the lack of

271
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
resources but

272
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,959
would be quite interesting to do that

273
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
but it cost only

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
uh

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
half an hour also to test this yeah i

276
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
think there are plenty of guys who who

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
would model a

278
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
yeah a system l1 model in in the tools

279
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,880
and and provide you the xmi

280
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,760
yeah so but well we need as an input we

281
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,920
need xmi conform to the standard and of

282
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
course

283
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
the the system l model in the xmi must

284
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
also be conformed to the system standard

285
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
yeah yeah so my fear would be that

286
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
you get in the same

287
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,240
troubles

288
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
why xmi exchange does not work between

289
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,920
tools

290
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
so but but maybe i'm wrong prove me

291
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
wrong please prove me wrong

292
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
okay so we have a model to model

293
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
transformation input is xmi so what what

294
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,160
is the target format then

295
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
uh so the the pilot implementation uh

296
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
maps yeah system lv1 xmi to system lv2

297
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
xmi

298
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,800
so the target format is again xmi and

299
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
system lb2

300
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
is not based on uml anymore but

301
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,360
on the kernel modeling language carmel

302
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
and but carmel and sysmol v2

303
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
are still based on moth the meter object

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
facility and xmi is a serialization of

305
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,160
morph so

306
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,199
we can

307
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,639
serialize the small v2 models to xmi so

308
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,040
our target format is again xmi

309
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
okay and is there already some kind of

310
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,480
validation suite for the system lv2 xmi

311
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,079
uh no

312
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,920
no so we

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
we get the xmi and that's

314
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,279
it

315
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,560
yeah and it's i guess yeah it's it's as

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
terrible human readable as it is in

317
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,680
system lb1 because yeah it's xml

318
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
and

319
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
if you can't validate can you verify it

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
yeah that's a challenge

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
the xmi is

322
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
well it's more a machine readable format

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
than a human readable format

324
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,199
of course a small xmi yeah you can check

325
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,639
some things but

326
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,800
even small models create very large xmis

327
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
so that's a nightmare

328
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,600
um

329
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
yeah and we solved that by again with

330
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
the eclipse

331
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
epsilon technology um

332
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,000
we have developed another tool

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,199
uh an xmi to system lv2 textual notation

334
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,199
transformation so

335
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,000
we take the system v2 xmi

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
um and transform it to system v2 texture

337
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,199
notation

338
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
and now we have a human readable format

339
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,959
and we can use it

340
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,839
as an input for the system v2 pilot

341
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,920
implementation which checks if the

342
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,199
syntax is correct um and we can even

343
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
generate the graphical notation then

344
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
again with the pilot implementation so

345
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
finally we can see the diagrams of

346
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,399
system lv1 input models and the diagrams

347
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
of this v2 output model

348
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,959
as far as they are available in the

349
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,600
jupyter notebook implementation or

350
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,399
the plateau ml thing right okay and of

351
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,320
course there are lots of issues but for

352
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,639
example in in system everyone often

353
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,839
elements have no name

354
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,639
an association and has no name and so on

355
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,440
but

356
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
if we

357
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
create the system lv2 texture notation

358
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
then we need a name

359
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
for the elements

360
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,160
okay so um i just saw we have uh the

361
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,639
first question in our live chat

362
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,160
so we have a question from mark and

363
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
he asks do you foresee other data

364
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
formats taking the place of xmi for

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
example json-ld

366
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,800
uh so not for the transformation

367
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
that will be based on

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,839
the transformation of our pilot

369
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,040
implementation the transformation itself

370
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
which will be part of the standard is uh

371
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,639
well transformational rules written in

372
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,680
ocl

373
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,120
um

374
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
but for seasonal v2 yes yeah there's of

375
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
course for example the json format and

376
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
the context mouse this is my v2 api

377
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,320
and

378
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
it's

379
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,160
ongoing work to define and

380
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
exchange format

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
yeah yeah okay i think this is very very

382
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,680
important to

383
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
to distinguish

384
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,959
yeah

385
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,680
but

386
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
to be to be honest there both are

387
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
exchange formats so xmi could be an

388
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
exchange format but

389
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
yeah a json-based exchange format is

390
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,839
is available in the api

391
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,039
services specification or the pilot

392
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,799
implementation so

393
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,199
there you can you can have a look if you

394
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,079
did not already

395
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,560
okay so um

396
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,359
[Music]

397
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
where have we been we have been ah okay

398
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
we get xmi out and then you transform it

399
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
in the system lv2 syntax and the

400
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
textural syntax you check it if it's uh

401
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
syntax is okay and so on

402
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
um but there there's still some doubt is

403
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,760
it correct so

404
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
how do you do you handle this manually

405
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
yeah so well the the system will be two

406
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,480
pilot implementation can verify if if

407
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,799
it's valid system lb2 but of course it

408
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
cannot verify if it's the correct output

409
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
of our transformation

410
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640
um so well in the end we have to

411
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
manually validate if it's the expected

412
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,360
output okay no no no

413
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
um

414
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,280
it reminds me of our paper about doll

415
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,919
and and so on but it's another topic

416
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,960
it'll all

417
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,919
also be

418
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,720
interesting in this area but uh yeah

419
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
yeah it's a

420
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
completely different topic yes and and

421
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,240
lack of resources and oh yeah oh yeah

422
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
okay so um

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,080
by the way we had an episode about doll

424
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
correct yeah with fabulous yeah yes

425
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
exactly

426
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
okay so um

427
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
let's let's have a closer look to the to

428
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
those two languages so um

429
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,200
i think

430
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,039
some of our listeners already know that

431
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,799
uh and you also uh told us before

432
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,679
that

433
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
we do not rely on the uml anymore we

434
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
rely on kermal now

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
and that also means that the concepts of

436
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,919
the languages are different and um

437
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,039
now

438
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,440
there might arise the question

439
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
is there

440
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
is there a concept in system else two

441
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
for every ssml one concept it says

442
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,200
successor and and so to say system l2 is

443
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
uh like system l1 plus extra stuff or

444
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,360
how can i imagine that

445
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
well the goal is that we can map

446
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
everything

447
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,039
uh so that systematic tool

448
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,960
covers everything

449
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,760
so every capability of the smell we want

450
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
um

451
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
and for most of the system we won

452
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,240
elements well the mapping is quite

453
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
apparent so

454
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
a package and system lv1 is mapped to

455
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
our packages as well v2

456
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,799
um it's even the same name

457
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
or a block is mapped to part definition

458
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
and so forth

459
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
um

460
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,360
but

461
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,240
some system lv1 elements have

462
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
rarely used properties for which there's

463
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,000
no

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,840
direct corresponding element and the

465
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
small v2

466
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,120
so for example this is where we one

467
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
block has a boolean property named is

468
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
encapsulated which can be used to

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
indicate that the block is used as a

470
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
black box

471
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
it has not an impact it's just the

472
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,159
scripture if not to say it's

473
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,559
encapsulated it's a black box don't look

474
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
inside

475
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
and in this way v2 there's no

476
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
corresponding element so

477
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
um and what we do

478
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
for such properties is that we define

479
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
in systematic two then user specific

480
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
metadata

481
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,280
which is attached to to the model

482
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
element so

483
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,840
um

484
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,880
so we use this for is encapsulated we

485
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,600
transform the block to part definition

486
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
and attach this meter data with the

487
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,880
encapsulated information

488
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,679
ah okay yeah yeah because it's

489
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
encapsulated it's not a

490
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,799
property of a block it's a property of

491
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,280
the stereotype block right the property

492
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
of the stereotype block yeah

493
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,679
okay yeah yeah

494
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
yeah so we can resolve that

495
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679
one but currently there are some

496
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,240
elements where we don't know yet how to

497
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
map them

498
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
okay

499
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
and do you have

500
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,159
other

501
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,280
other examples so

502
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
yeah so for for the elements we cannot

503
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
map

504
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
for example

505
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,400
um

506
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
in systematic one um

507
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,240
we have the the actions uh in the

508
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
activity world

509
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
and uh system v1 or respectively uml

510
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
that he finds around

511
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
many 30 to 40 different action kinds not

512
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
like the call behavior action

513
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
actions and signal action

514
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
and so on action

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
um

516
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
and we can map the commonly used ones

517
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
like call behavior action but still need

518
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
to analyze the mapping for for some

519
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
others so

520
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
um

521
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,720
another example is package merge

522
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
you cannot map package much at the

523
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
moment so you see it's mainly the more

524
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,360
exotic constructs that worry us but uh

525
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
well

526
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
also for for them we need a solution

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
and did you did you find a completely

528
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,200
missing language concept and if yes how

529
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
how would this be translated

530
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
um

531
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
i don't think there are completely

532
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
missing concepts

533
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,840
there are some missing elements i like

534
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
this encapsulated and

535
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
we can resolve that

536
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
but completely missing concepts i don't

537
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,520
think that there are any but however we

538
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
i must admit that we have not analyzed

539
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,760
the whole language in detail yet uh so

540
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,679
for example the interaction

541
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
uh so the sequence diagram stuff is

542
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
still on our to-do list so we think we

543
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,799
can map it well there are corresponding

544
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,919
concepts in systematic too uh but i'm

545
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,760
not sure about all the details so the

546
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
detailed elements of of interaction if

547
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
they can be mapped

548
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
okay

549
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,960
okay and

550
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
uh our

551
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
so so you already mentioned it so the

552
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,480
behavioral models of system l2 are

553
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
examples of this right so um

554
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
yeah let me think

555
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
so they are defined differently than in

556
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
in seasonal v1 you can you can

557
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
model the same

558
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
thing but

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,679
it's different yeah

560
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,679
yeah so you have in the end the same

561
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,640
semantic of your

562
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
the constructs are completely

563
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
different now so for example the system

564
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,240
will be two uh

565
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
we want activities

566
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
they are based on the

567
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
token semantics

568
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,919
and the token semantics does not exist

569
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,360
in system lv2

570
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
um

571
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
activities exist in system lv2 uh well

572
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,559
they are named action definitions and

573
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,880
this will be too but they are not based

574
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
on a token

575
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
right mm-hmm

576
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
correct so we we map now the system l

577
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,279
uh we want activities to system early

578
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
two elements

579
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,000
uh that represent then the same flows of

580
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
the same meaning

581
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
the model but a completely different

582
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,360
construct so

583
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
yeah yeah okay got it got it

584
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
okay so um

585
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,159
let's

586
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,960
switch a little bit to an another

587
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,480
view on on this uh on this topic so um

588
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
we'd already talked about we want to

589
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
translate something from one language in

590
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,559
another one some

591
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,600
times we said oh we have to

592
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
transform it somehow so

593
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,400
what what do we have a transformation or

594
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,679
translation

595
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah that's a good question

596
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,039
and

597
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
it depends how you define a

598
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,440
transformation and translation

599
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,320
so

600
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
for me translation is more

601
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
more a one-to-one mapping like you find

602
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,279
in natural language dictionaries for a

603
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
word in language a you find a word in

604
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,400
language b

605
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,039
or maybe also some alternatives or so

606
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,080
um

607
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
so i can translate and translate

608
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
the words

609
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
very well then but if i would translate

610
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,039
a whole text

611
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,320
in this way

612
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
the result is typically

613
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
bumpy to wrong

614
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,039
like the the computer-based translations

615
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,320
many years ago

616
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
yeah

617
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,559
so

618
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,360
then i need an additional transformation

619
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
so which means i have to build other

620
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,840
constructs in the target language which

621
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,279
depends on on the context

622
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,320
do you have an example for this

623
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
uh

624
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
yeah maybe a good example to stay with

625
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,159
the natural languages are perhaps

626
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,240
sayings

627
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
some can be translated uh others

628
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,159
well for others it's rather

629
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
very funny confusion yeah yes so

630
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
for example

631
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
well it's easy to understand the

632
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,360
following if you know english and german

633
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
but you know one language is difficult

634
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
but for example the english saying it's

635
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
raining cats and dogs

636
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
that would probably be understood if

637
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
translated directly into german but

638
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,120
would be very

639
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,360
irritating yeah yeah translating it

640
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
literally would uh yeah

641
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,679
yeah so in german you would say in

642
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,039
german as

643
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,000
cuban which translates directly into the

644
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,039
english

645
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,840
it rains out of

646
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
buckets which is also a picture which

647
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,080
might be a little bit

648
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,559
more natural than writing cats and dogs

649
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,960
but yeah it could also be irritating

650
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
yeah yes exactly yes and there are many

651
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,880
more examples um and which reminds me of

652
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
the great conversation i had with john

653
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,799
siegel of the omg many years ago

654
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,880
we wrote many emails on technical stuff

655
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,679
but we also often introduce ourselves

656
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,559
each other to sayings in english and

657
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,080
in german if what happens when you

658
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
translate them directly it was very

659
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,520
funny um

660
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,200
okay but another example is in german

661
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
the coup from ice cream

662
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,440
which means in english to get the cow

663
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,360
from the eyes

664
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,919
which means uh solving the problem yeah

665
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,559
yes exactly

666
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,679
okay nice nice so but we did not i think

667
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,679
we did not answer you did not answer my

668
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,760
question is it is it a transformational

669
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
translation

670
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
uh so for for the sayings you need a

671
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
transformation i would say

672
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
the translation so that which is for me

673
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
more the direct mapping uh that does not

674
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,559
work so yeah

675
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,960
transformation and for sml

676
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,679
and for system it's a transformation

677
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,840
it's also a transformation okay yeah

678
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
yeah so um

679
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
yeah i guess so transformation so

680
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
although some

681
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,960
some elements can be very directly

682
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
mapped like package to package and so on

683
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,559
um

684
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
we i think we have all we always have to

685
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,679
create more elements in the target so in

686
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,120
system lv2

687
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
uh so for example each element is is in

688
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
the name space

689
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,399
now and in system v1 this is defined by

690
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,080
a property so if if a block a

691
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,720
is

692
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
in a package

693
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,039
then this is specified in the property

694
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,679
of the package in the media level

695
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,320
and in system v2 it is a relationship

696
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,880
called membership

697
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
additionally so it's

698
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
it's yeah that's that's a good example

699
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
here

700
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,919
yeah yeah okay cool

701
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,720
and

702
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
and this transformation uh is it a

703
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,440
one-way street or can i also get sysmail

704
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
v2 models into system lb1

705
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,640
um

706
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,840
no you can't so so our transformation

707
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
which will be part of the

708
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,559
system rv2 standard this is a one way um

709
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,399
and

710
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,440
well if the system v2 is is much more

711
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
expressive than system lv1

712
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,480
so

713
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,279
many constructs cannot be mapped at all

714
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,159
but

715
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,000
if we take

716
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,399
a system lb2 model

717
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,240
which contains only concepts of system

718
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
lv1

719
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,520
so for example a result of our

720
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,039
transformation

721
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
so we transform this way we want to

722
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,320
assist my v2 and would like to transform

723
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,240
this back to this maybe one

724
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
uh in theory this would partially work

725
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,159
but

726
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,159
there are cases where the reverse

727
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
mapping is not unique

728
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,399
okay and you can't ensure that

729
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,960
you really have the same semantics then

730
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
uh

731
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,720
or or do you have any any example to

732
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,559
clarify that

733
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,840
well an example uh

734
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,039
currently working on that one is um

735
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,600
are the power properties uh that's an

736
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
example and system will be one they're

737
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
typically defined using the composition

738
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,320
relationship

739
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,360
um

740
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,880
so we have these typical system

741
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,399
breakdown structure block definition

742
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
diagrams these trees

743
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,799
with the composition relationship which

744
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
is formerly an association

745
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,440
relationship

746
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,360
and

747
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,159
now it gets a little bit tricky

748
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
and it doesn't apply universally but

749
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,720
normally we do not map this composition

750
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,679
relationship so this association

751
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,520
to system lb2

752
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,159
so to put it simply a block

753
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,840
so we have a block a compositional

754
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,480
relationship and a part property

755
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
and this may be one becomes a part

756
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
definition and a participant will be two

757
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
so we we omit the association

758
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,720
okay

759
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,679
um

760
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,480
so that's the one way but now uh in

761
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
systematic one

762
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,720
it's it's rarely used but you can define

763
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,640
part properties without this composition

764
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
relationship that's allowed since the

765
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
smell

766
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,760
1.5 or 1.4 i don't remember exactly okay

767
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
never heard from that i don't know but

768
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,240
it's allowed you can do that

769
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,640
and if i do the transformation with such

770
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,159
a model

771
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,000
it would create the same system v2 model

772
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,480
from it as i have

773
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,519
this maybe one model with the

774
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,120
composition relationship so two

775
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
differences maybe one models lead to the

776
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,480
same system will be two model and you

777
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
cannot

778
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,519
okay yeah yeah okay there

779
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,760
and we have this

780
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,480
ambiguity okay cool yeah

781
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,799
and i i guess there's some more examples

782
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,279
but mm-hmm

783
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
yeah yeah and that's what what you what

784
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
you said before yeah we have much more

785
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
expressiveness in so small v2

786
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
so yeah you would have an ambiguity and

787
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
it's just another one

788
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,880
okay cool um but i guess you do not only

789
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,559
test uh block a to b and a block has a

790
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
part property and that's it so so what

791
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
kind of example models do you use

792
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,679
right yes so so we have tons of those

793
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,360
very small models

794
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
um

795
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,519
where each model is has only a very

796
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,080
small set of elements so for example an

797
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,519
empty block that's block a

798
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,279
and then we have another model a block

799
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,440
with some properties and so forth

800
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
we use those models to develop the

801
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
transformation

802
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,640
right sure test one specific aspect

803
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,320
but for the real validation we need a

804
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,440
test suite um and

805
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,559
well again the lack of resources

806
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,440
but also the reuse of already existing

807
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,240
things so we decided to use the

808
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
model interchange working group test

809
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
cases for this purpose

810
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,480
um

811
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,880
the my wic test cases model education

812
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
working group uh they were developed

813
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,440
several years ago or maybe 10 years ago

814
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,679
almost 10 years ago i think in an

815
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,279
omg working group

816
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,840
to test the the exchange of models

817
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
between tools

818
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,519
wasn't here

819
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,440
wasn't it even at sharing this group

820
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
uh

821
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,159
yeah and any case he was involved but

822
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,360
i'm not sure if

823
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
maybe he also was the chair of that

824
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,679
group yeah i i remember

825
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,600
really

826
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,240
and and they had well almost the same

827
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,640
requirement that we have a complete

828
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,519
coverage of the model elements

829
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,600
as complete as possible so

830
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,320
uh so it's a nice example of reusing and

831
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
not reinventing the wheel yeah yeah so

832
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
we use those test cases now they are

833
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
available

834
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,159
um as camille models but also as xmi

835
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,000
models um

836
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
they're already there on the omg servers

837
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
and we use those

838
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
test cases now for our transformation

839
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,360
okay and

840
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,039
do you also

841
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,159
handle those cases those arrow cases so

842
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,679
to say then

843
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,840
when when something cannot be

844
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,159
transformed

845
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,679
um

846
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,720
also well this it's it's not part of the

847
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,360
transformation specification

848
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
um it's a task of the transformation

849
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,880
tool

850
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,080
um

851
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,799
and our pilot implementation cannot do

852
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,679
it so far and we will probably not

853
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,960
include

854
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
any convenience functions for the time

855
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
being due to our time constraints we

856
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
have lack of resources and time

857
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,679
constraints

858
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,520
okay but it could be a requirement in

859
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
the specification that implementations

860
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
should do so

861
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,918
yeah sure that could theoretically exist

862
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,760
but well there's not

863
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,520
there's a requirement but no not yet

864
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
well the specification uh also does not

865
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,359
tell modeling tools what to do when the

866
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,159
user models nonsense or so another

867
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,719
same so we always assume that the input

868
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,159
is not garbage

869
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,960
okay okay

870
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
and

871
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,679
different question but

872
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,918
some of our listeners know already the

873
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,159
pilot implementation of

874
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,480
the language itself and

875
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,359
the api services so is there also a

876
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
publicly available uh transformation

877
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,599
implementation

878
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,000
um no unfortunately not so currently it

879
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,599
is it's a private github repository so

880
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
it's not public yet

881
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
and well the reason it is not that it is

882
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
a secret or so

883
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
the reason is well we already mentioned

884
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,760
lack of resources uh to make it public

885
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
uh we could have

886
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,839
we would have to provide a documentation

887
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,280
that cost time

888
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,079
and well and probably we get quite a few

889
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,400
questions then uh that we should answer

890
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
now so installation problems and and so

891
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
on so

892
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,599
um

893
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,440
but i can really imagine that we will

894
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,119
make the pilot implementation public in

895
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,760
the future so

896
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
maybe someone will use it

897
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,839
as a basis to turn it into a more

898
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,359
serious tool that's only a pilot

899
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,200
implementation it's not

900
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,680
uh planned to be a serious tool so for a

901
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
real project

902
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,640
so i could imagine that uh

903
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
that you could

904
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
could publish it as a web service so i

905
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,640
upload my system lv1 xmi and i get an v2

906
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,800
xmi as a response would that be suitable

907
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,200
yeah so technically it would be

908
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
possible to do that so if anyone is

909
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,400
interested in working on it well

910
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,680
it might work out and

911
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,359
as a as a prototype or like a pilot

912
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,320
implementation thing um you can use our

913
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,440
pilot transformation pilot

914
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
implementation for that

915
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,640
but i don't think for us here just um

916
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,359
web service

917
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,760
and i think it would cost quite a lot of

918
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,119
effort

919
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,200
i don't know is it is it scriptable so

920
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,640
you said you're using a tool chain

921
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,079
uh from from eclipse tools so

922
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,359
i don't know

923
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,520
uh i don't know if it's possible i

924
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,000
maybe it's possible so it's

925
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
uh it's atl the atlas information

926
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
language code that we have in the end

927
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
that is used i don't know if it's

928
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
possible to script it

929
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
um sounds

930
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
sounds for me like

931
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
you have some some inputs outputs and so

932
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,119
on and you just have to

933
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,160
yeah

934
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
to bring them

935
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
in a command line

936
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
script and

937
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,800
yeah

938
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
yeah

939
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,240
would be worth looking at it

940
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,040
okay cool

941
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,680
[Music]

942
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,040
let me

943
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
let me think what

944
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,079
what we talked about so we've talked

945
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,400
about um

946
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
the pilot implementation and

947
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
yeah um

948
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,640
are there already tool vendors who are

949
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
interested in this transformation

950
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,280
uh

951
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,320
yes so it's currently it's not nothing

952
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
is available

953
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
but we talked with eastvan raj from ink

954
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,119
ferry

955
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,800
at the last omg meeting in washington um

956
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
by the way we had also a podcast with

957
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
eastman

958
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
together with enrique from vitek some

959
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
time ago

960
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
well we already covered a lot of stuff

961
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
oh yeah

962
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,680
so yeah and east one uh respectively

963
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
inquiry his company uh plans to build a

964
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,839
commercial transformation tool that

965
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,400
transforms system lv1 models to system

966
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,839
lb2 um and in particular large models so

967
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
oh okay

968
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
well i think it could make sense to do

969
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
another podcast with him

970
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,480
finish his tool

971
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
or at least a prototype of the tool yeah

972
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
yeah

973
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
yeah okay

974
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,520
so

975
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
um

976
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
i think that was already

977
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
a lot of stuff

978
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,599
and

979
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,640
um

980
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,359
yeah if if if you like topics like this

981
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,720

993
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,240
a big community uh

994
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,599
when we when we started we we said ah

995
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,240
let's begin and if less than 10 people

996
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,320
are listening to it we can leave it

997
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,760
again but wow it's it's really nice to

998
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
see uh yeah in the beginning if i

999
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
remember correctly we

1000
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
would like to listen to a podcast but

1001
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,280
there was no mse podcast so we decided

1002
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
yeah

1003
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,760
okay so tim uh

1004
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
what's up in the next episode

1005
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
yeah so the plan is uh to talk um again

1006
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
about system lv2 well this is my tools

1007
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
on its final run so it makes sense to to

1008
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,079
cover it

1009
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,200
uh now a little bit more extensive and

1010
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,400
our guest will be outside of it so

1011
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
that will be quite interesting um

1012
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,400
to get a very good insights into system

1013
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
we too yeah so to say he is a kind of

1014
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,720
the father of of of susan lv2

1015
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,760
yes yeah yeah one of the fathers yeah

1016
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
there are many fathers and then

1017
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,079
yeah

1018
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,920
yeah definitely so

1019
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,960

1020
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,920
okay

1021
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240

um

1030
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,359

1031
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,000
or two years later okay after the

1032
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,160
