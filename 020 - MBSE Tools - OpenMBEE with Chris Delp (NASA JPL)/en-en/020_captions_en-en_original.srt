1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,840
welcome to a new episode of the mbse

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
podcast

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
today we will

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
have a meeting on the west coast of the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
united states so to say so good morning

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
to our guest chris delp who is a group

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
supervisor nasa jpl

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
so that jet propulsion laboratory if you

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,439
don't know it

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
and one of the masterminds behind

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
openmbe

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
we know chris very well from various omg

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,680
meetings but please chris introduce

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,640
yourself first

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,239
yeah i think i think you covered it i

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,399
work at the jet propulsion laboratory

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
i'm the group supervisor for the

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
software systems solutions engineering

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
group and our group

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
produces the systems engineering

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
environment led by robert carban who's a

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,079
another mbse celebrity

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
um

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
and uh for for the missions that we

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,879
produce at jpl

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,360
and i was also part of the original team

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
that came up with openmb at jpl

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,240
yeah great so great to have you on the

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
show chris and

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
well probably not everyone knows openmbe

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
so the first question is what is openmb

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
what does it stand for and well how did

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
it come about

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
so openmb stands for the open model

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,880
based engineering environment uh and the

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
the general premise of openmb is that

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
it's firstly a community in the open

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
source world

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
around model-based engineering practices

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
models and software that support

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
model-based engineering

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
so you have to know a little bit about

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,240
what model-based engineering is there's

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
probably some debate around what that is

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
i think in the openmb community we're

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,520
less about defining what that is

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
um and more about

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
just you know enabling the practices and

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
helping the whole concept and evolve so

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,038
whatever your model is

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,000
uh

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,720
openmb wants to talk about it

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
the

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
products that exist are i'm sorry as an

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
open source project you're supposed

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
about projects so the projects that

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
exist in openmbe

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
are principally

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
the open se cookbook which was

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
contributed by robert carbon

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
the

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
model the model management system which

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
is the core

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
uh server product around managing

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,040
engineering models

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
the view editor which is a web

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
application that allows uh document

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
based interactivity around

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
it's a model based document application

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
is maybe a better way to say it

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,239
that allows you to integrate the

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
descriptions of

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,599
different models

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,480
um

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
and then the mdk

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
collection which is the model

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
development kit so various tools

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
uh

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
that perform different kinds of modeling

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
we have an architecture called the mdk

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
the most famous one is the magic draw i

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,040
guess now cameo

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
model development kit which integrates

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
magic draws to smell

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
uh bpmn etc into the openmb

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799
open source environment so

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
these products exist

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
they don't but they don't necessarily

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
limit the definition of what openmb is

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
openmb is firstly a community uh like i

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
said so

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
um

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
some some misunderstandings are oh well

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
if i don't have anything that integrates

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
with nms view editor then i'm not part

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
of openmb that's definitely not the case

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,560
but anybody who has open source models

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,959
open source practices anything they want

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,040
to bring and contribute to openmb as

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
that open source community that's really

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
the

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
beach head that we're

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,519
trying to forward of things along on

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,120
and chris can you

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
give us a little bit more uh historic

106
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,080
information so what what was the

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
motivation to do something like

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,320
it's a huge thing sure in

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,918
mean time

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
sure it has it i think it has kind of an

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
interesting origin story um

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
and the word part of the origin story

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,600
comes from

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
iso and robert carbon who i mentioned a

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
few times so he'd have to tell the eso

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
side

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
but the jpl side

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
occurred when i was early in my career

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
at jpl model-based systems engineering

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
was very new

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
and i think the prevailing premise at

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
the time was that

123
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
documents are bad and documents are

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,440
going to go away and someday everybody

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
will just be working with models

126
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
um

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
in retrospect probably a bit naive uh

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
especially considering that probably

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
lots of software developers had similar

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
uh hopes of that someday their code

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
would just be self-documenting

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
yeah so we started uh on a project at

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
jpl to modernize

134
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,720
mission operations with modeling

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
um

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
and

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,320
what we what we found initially is that

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
and kind of organically was that

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
while the while the models were great

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
for solving engineering problems we had

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,240
a difficult time communicating them um a

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
lot of people in systems engineering

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
traditionally

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,759
uh build

145
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
uh documents right and

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
so for folks who were interested in

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
models they couldn't reconcile the

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
models they were making with the

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
products that they were being asked to

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,039
produce

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,400
um

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
and so we started connecting the two up

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
how can we you know take these models

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
and generate the products that people

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
need uh and that's where the first

156
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,039
kernel of openmb of the jpl side was

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,840
born

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
called doctrine so doctrine built an

159
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
executable modeling language

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
to generate the actual the document to

161
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
query the model

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
and and basically linearize a particular

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
story or viewpoint into how the

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
uh

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
how the how the model is describing

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
something and that's when we discovered

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
ieee 1471

168
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
whereas it's i think now referred to as

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
iso 4 2010 which is the standard for our

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,479
systems architecture description

171
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
and that talks about view and viewpoints

172
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
um and that was a real game changer

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
because the model could now be unified

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
with the products that that systems

175
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639
engineers needed to make

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
and they suddenly had a whole new avenue

177
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
of controlling the quality of the

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
technical content

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
so the thought experiment i always give

180
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
in this part is kind of like you know if

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,199
you have

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
uh somebody who's got like a really

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
great simulink model and it can answer

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
all kinds of questions about the system

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
or maybe in today's speed could be more

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
of a cst model the next cable system

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
model or a delica model or something um

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
and you've got your requirements and

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
doors or whatever

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
uh

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
and then you've got um

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,759
um

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
the presentations you have to give right

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
and in these powerpoint decks so um

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
you've got all this rich technical

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
content

197
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,639
um

198
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,960
but how do you get it into

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,039
something that people can consume in

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,560
these reviews so

201
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
um

202
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
you can imagine having

203
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
having the live connection to all that

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
information would be a much richer

205
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
experience so that

206
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
that kind of became the goal um

207
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
we started generating the documents

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
magic draw is a desktop tool so suddenly

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,199
everybody's desktop was filling up with

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,560
documents we created a platform called

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
doc web which basically just

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
automated the production of those

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
documents and stored them on the web so

214
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,080
that you could browse them

215
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
and users just loved it and the first

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
question they asked was where's the edit

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,919
button and then uh view editor and mms

218
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
were born out of that so

219
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
um

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
and it's so it's a lot of it is built

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,080
around

222
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
web-based concepts and bringing that

223
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
information to the web

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
and also for me personally kind of

225
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
reconciling that idea

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,039
that no

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,080
not everybody's going to use models

228
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,599
and that really there's still a

229
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
communication practice and systems

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
engineering that has to take place where

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
we can linearize the story and

232
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
communicate these views

233
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,479
across disciplines

234
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,599
and pull

235
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,279
pull people's uh

236
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,839
disparate models in in together to that

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,440
story earlier

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
um and that leads of course to the

239
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,599
digital twin and perpetual you know

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
continuous integration and all that

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
stuff so

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
uh if i understood it correctly you

243
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
started with system a right you

244
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
mentioned magic draw models and so so

245
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
you starting with system models

246
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,800
and which other kind of models are

247
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
can also be integrated in in the mms

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
so today's mms

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
comes in

250
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
today's released mms comes in a flavor

251
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
where you can publish the json format of

252
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,519
any model into the mms

253
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,720
um

254
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,680
so

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
what you get out of the box today uh

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
pretty much anything that can interact

257
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
with web services like python or

258
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
mathematica or something like that

259
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
can produce and consume models in this

260
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
way

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
um

262
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
and of course we have the magic draw

263
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
integration

264
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
and i believe i believe there is

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
somebody who has contributed an early

266
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
papyrus integration but i haven't seen

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,519
it yet

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
um

269
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
and there there are there are other

270
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,080
contributions coming that i can't talk

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
about yet um

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,519
but the the the next version of mms

273
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,519
is ms5 is completely transformational

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,560
the

275
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,760
a long

276
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,959
a long sought technology that we waited

277
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
a long time to mature was the graph

278
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
database

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
i think we we all in this sphere have

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
seen the significance of graphs in in

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
how models are

282
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
handled in technology

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,440
um

284
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,279
but when we built the first version of

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
the mms such things were

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
fantasy only

287
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,839
even the even the fledgling

288
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
things that existed out there even the

289
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
things you could buy were were

290
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
difficult to scale there were no

291
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
standard interfaces

292
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
you know things like gremlin tinker pop

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
didn't exist the semantic web community

294
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
existed but they didn't have the

295
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,600
uh technology horsepower to build

296
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
horizontally scalable web services that

297
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,279
could handle

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
millions of millions of elements you

299
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
know if you

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
look at the amount of model elements and

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
then something something from like

302
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,519
boeing who's one of the openmb

303
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,640
contributors i mean they have

304
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
more model elements that i could ever

305
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
even have dreamed

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,399
and we were stunned when they were able

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
to put them all into mms we're like wow

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
we didn't

309
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
we had no idea that it could scale

310
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
okay that sounds uh

311
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
very very interesting and promising so

312
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,880
um

313
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
maybe we should

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
tell the people how they can try it by

315
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
their own so how how can i get openmbe

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
is this a web service is it something i

317
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
can download

318
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
it it's both actually so and that's a

319
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
that's a good question so

320
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
openmb is open source um

321
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,920
and it's available on openmb.org

322
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,320
and for the mms in particular

323
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
i think the cautionary tale that always

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
comes here is

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
it's it is a web service so you so in

326
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
order to get it working

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
you will either have to know how to

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,120
install and administrate

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
a linux server essentially

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,959
and so sometimes that that definitely

331
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
catches people by surprise they download

332
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
them onto their laptop and then they

333
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
can't figure out what to do

334
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
so yeah it's not a standalone desktop um

335
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
there is a host and environment

336
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
provided by the so that

337
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
is used by the omg and some other

338
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
activities

339
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
so you can at least test

340
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
test it out yourself and and test taste

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
it if you like

342
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,839
um

343
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
and kind of see how it works

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
um

345
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
so those are the two options there are

346
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
uh the opensc cookbook of course you can

347
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,320
download and load that into magic draw

348
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
or read the documents of it um

349
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,000
and the magic drop the magic drop plugin

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
for openmb does allow you to do things

351
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
with doctrine and and stuff like that

352
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
locally in your magic draw desktop

353
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,600
sessions without connecting to mms um

354
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
so yeah that's that's kind of a high

355
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
level uh picture and of course you can

356
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
also attend the openmp community

357
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,760
meetings which happen uh every two weeks

358
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,120
um

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
and the upcoming openmb workshop at the

360
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
coc you can cociw this weekend

361
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,399
or monday technically

362
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,760
so

363
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,839
what would you recommend a real

364
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,920
industrial project uh if they would like

365
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
to use openmpe so what well is it

366
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
recommendable for for a real project to

367
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,320
use it or

368
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
uh well you need support and things like

369
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
that so what what were the first steps

370
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
or what would you recommend for them

371
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,199
and that's that's an interesting thread

372
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,240
of discussion as well um

373
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
the use of open source software in

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
various

375
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,680
industrial scale organizations

376
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
runs the spectrum on earth today

377
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,279
some some companies obviously like

378
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,279
google or

379
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,040
maybe spacex are

380
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
are hawkishly

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
forward-looking in this space

382
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
more traditional defense industry folks

383
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,079
are more reluctant and of course with

384
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
open source in general there's a

385
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
range of misnomers

386
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,320
i think the log for j issue recently

387
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
helps people understand that just

388
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,600
because you buy something from a vendor

389
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
doesn't mean you're not using open

390
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
source

391
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
it just means

392
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,920
it just means you're paying for it so um

393
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,680
so for somebody starting out like that i

394
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,399
mean i think firstly it's kind of a

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,199
an

396
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
introspective in the company

397
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
like how does that company use open

398
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
source what kind of resources do they

399
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
have um for for companies that have very

400
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,399
old school i.t departments where they

401
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,800
mostly host file servers and license

402
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,399
servers and haven't gotten into web

403
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
services yet it'll it'll be

404
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
uh

405
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
more of it i won't say necessarily more

406
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
of a challenge but it'll be more effort

407
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,320
so

408
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
because using using the mms in

409
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
particular means you're potentially

410
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
pushing on the company's posture towards

411
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
a shift towards web services from

412
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,360
traditional

413
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
computing services

414
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
um

415
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,800
and mms4 is horizontally scalable it

416
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
runs if you run it on docker so

417
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,320
um

418
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
it'll it'll

419
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,680
it'll it potentially could use a lot of

420
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,399
computers so um

421
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,760
and

422
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
that so that's kind of where it starts

423
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,839
and then from there you know then the

424
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
main thing is are you are you ready to

425
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
put something like that together um

426
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,839
and so

427
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,279
how that's worked

428
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
from an experiential standpoint i mean

429
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
if you look at how boeing deployed

430
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
openmb

431
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
they have a

432
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
really really big enterprise i.t system

433
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
and they were able to

434
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
you know make those deployments

435
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,360
work they contribute back code they're

436
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,800
they're fully in

437
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
um but they had to go through their own

438
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
stuff so that that would that probably

439
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
that might not be a bad podcasting day

440
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,839
to get them to talk about

441
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
what they can talk about um

442
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
whereas if you look at uh

443
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
i won't

444
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
if you look at like how how ford is

445
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
initially set it up uh i think they

446
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
started as kind of with a kind of a

447
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
small r d

448
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
effort just to kind of see what it did

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
as part of how they were investigating

450
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
mbsc in general

451
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
um

452
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
so and then

453
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
the

454
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
the corporate side as well because i

455
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
mentioned vendors specifically

456
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
uh some vendors have adopted openmv

457
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,160
technology into their product as well um

458
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
one of them of course the most famous

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
one of course being no magic now just so

460
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
um

461
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
they pulled aspects of it into their

462
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,959
products so

463
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
and then the main the main pieces of

464
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,839
openmb use uh

465
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,160
the apache 2 license which is commercial

466
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
friendly

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,959
so

468
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
vendors can some vendors have taken

469
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
openmv technology and chosen not to

470
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
disclose

471
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
that they've done it

472
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,880
um

473
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,240
and that's

474
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
they're fine to do so

475
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,959
uh

476
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,679
the

477
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,640
the sound bite i always give on this is

478
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,079
you know jpl's participation in this was

479
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,599
we we couldn't buy what we needed to do

480
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,839
what we needed to do at the time and so

481
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
we built it

482
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
but that didn't signal that we were

483
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
ready to move into

484
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
uh

485
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
building software products instead of

486
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
space missions really

487
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,400
we open sourced it

488
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,120
as a way to communicate the requirements

489
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,679
of what we need

490
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,320
and what happened is this you know along

491
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
with how with eso and and then later

492
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,080
boeing this turned into this uh

493
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,720
you know movement of different points of

494
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
view around how open source can work

495
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
with engineering environments and models

496
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
and so forth so

497
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
cool

498
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,880
so let's assume i

499
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
download the thing install it and

500
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,760
i like it um how can i get in touch with

501
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
the openmbe community you already

502
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,320
mentioned that there will be a workshop

503
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
on the

504
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,320
international workshop from ecosi next

505
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
week

506
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
and

507
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
i guess there is a public select channel

508
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
isn't it

509
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
correct yeah if you go to openmb.org you

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
can click the participate link at the

511
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
top and you'll see the slack channel

512
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
you'll see the google group

513
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
the github repo

514
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,480
um the the the folks in openmb for

515
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,799
example who are developers

516
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,679
tend mostly to communicate on github

517
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,720
they're not

518
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
not chatty folks you can ping them on

519
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
slack channel but as tim has seen

520
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
sometimes it takes some uh

521
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
nudging to get them to respond um

522
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
and uh the google group of course and

523
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
then we have a

524
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,360
a community presentation meeting every

525
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
every month a couple times a month and

526
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
the leadership meeting so and it's

527
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,559
entirely open anybody can participate in

528
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
the leadership meeting

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
or the community meeting uh provided

530
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
that ever there's a consensus that the

531
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
topics they're bringing up are are part

532
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,440
of our scope and charter so

533
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
there's no formal organization behind

534
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,880
openmb there's no the openmpe limited so

535
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
it's just a group of people mainly

536
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
stuff by by people from nasa jpl then

537
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
that's correct

538
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
it is

539
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
the the community itself is

540
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,559
is i would say

541
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
at the moment there are folks from ford

542
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
boeing

543
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
lockheed

544
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,559
um

545
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
i believe there's still some folks

546
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,679
showing up from raytheon

547
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,919
uh from the academic side there's folks

548
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,320
from georgia tech and stevens

549
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
uh and of course jpl and we have had

550
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,600
other nasa folks show up outside jpl 2

551
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,799
occasionally

552
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,000
um

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,880
the

554
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
the

555
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,720
software portion the the asset portion

556
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
of openmb is

557
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
sponsored by num focus which is an open

558
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
source software foundation similar to

559
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,159
apache or clips or something like that

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
and the main service they provide is

561
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,039
uh

562
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,600
indemnification

563
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,039
so

564
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,880
they are there to help open source

565
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
projects protect their assets because

566
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
one of the reasons we chose the apache 2

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
license is because there are cases where

568
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,679
other open source licenses or even no

569
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,520
open source license published with the

570
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,720
code

571
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
has allowed folks to patent it and then

572
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,720
sue the creators for possessing it

573
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
so

574
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
um at least that's what i was told

575
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,039
i don't have a specific example for that

576
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,080
that's that's that was one of the uh uh

577
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
highlights that we got from folks in

578
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,200
apache about why the apache 2 license is

579
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,159
good so but num focus protects you know

580
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,120
the openmp name trademark uh copyright

581
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
all that kind of stuff so that

582
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,559
um

583
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
we have that that so

584
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
um

585
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
yeah but the community at large is is

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
um

587
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,919
it's kind of the community at large so

588
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,400
it's intended to be open we do publish a

589
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,200
uh

590
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
uh

591
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
a code of conduct i think we use the

592
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,760
inner source con the open source commons

593
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,240
i think it's called source conduct so um

594
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
but it's a yeah open source communities

595
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
are largely self-governing uh funding is

596
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
you know

597
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
there's no no you ask

598
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,400
there's no owner of openmp no

599
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
the owner of the open open is the

600
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
community

601
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,360
that's correct

602
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,840
and and it's licensed as such so

603
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
um

604
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
yeah any any

605
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,440
anybody can fork it own it use it and

606
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
you know it's in some ways it's like a

607
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
new way of standardizing things right so

608
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
um

609
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,159
but code is a little more complex than

610
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,960
documents so

611
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,679
and uh if i'm a vendor and i would like

612
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
to contribute

613
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,760
an integration to my tool

614
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,720
um

615
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
is this

616
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
is this possible in an easy way and

617
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,600
is it still my code how does that work

618
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
sure no that's a really good question i

619
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
mean if if a vendor wanted to

620
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,960
integrate with openmd there's no

621
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
requirement that they contribute any of

622
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
that code um

623
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
they they would they could build a

624
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
completely commercial integration

625
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
um

626
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
and

627
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,360
yeah

628
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
and if they if that's how they choose to

629
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,200
do it that's how they choose to do it

630
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
they could open source

631
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
uh

632
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
the integration as well um and maintain

633
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
it through openmbe

634
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
um

635
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah i think that's

636
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,559
that's

637
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
a pretty open

638
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
uh

639
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
situation

640
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
about how daso has done it is they took

641
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,919
portions of the openmb code integrated

642
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,240
it into their product and then they sell

643
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,720
that commercial product um

644
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
and i think that's fine i call this kind

645
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
of the technical morality case right i

646
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,039
think the openmb community is concerned

647
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
with the

648
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,679
technical correctness of

649
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,440
a model based engineering environment

650
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,880
and the code that supports it

651
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
so in that respect somebody who's

652
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,840
offering that as a service is i think

653
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
absolutely welcome to

654
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,840
commercialize that and take advantage of

655
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,799
that

656
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,000
like so many

657
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
organizations have with open source

658
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,799
software like ibm's recent acquisition

659
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,600
of red hat for example linux kernel

660
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
still open source so and now you have to

661
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,919
pay well i guess you always have to pay

662
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,000
for red hat at some level but yeah it

663
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
seems like it's getting a little tighter

664
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,440
now

665
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
no more centos the same way it used to

666
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
be so is there already a

667
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
full service provider for openmb a

668
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
professional one or do you think that

669
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,080
there will be some service providers in

670
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,039
the future where i can as a company just

671
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,120
buy it like i can buy teamwork cloud

672
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,279
server today

673
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
um i think

674
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
i i haven't seen anybody that's offering

675
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
that um

676
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,400
directly um i know of cases where

677
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
vendors or contractors have made such

678
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,120
arrangements with organizations

679
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,799
um

680
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,520
so but no there isn't like a

681
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,400
a commercial enterprise as yet that has

682
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
appeared

683
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,360
to provide openmb as a product

684
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
um

685
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
like you might like red hat or something

686
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
like that

687
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,320
um

688
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,760
but

689
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,080
hey i think i think actually sysiml 2

690
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,480
will will really push on that so the

691
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
the key the key feat the key future

692
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
features of the openmb software are

693
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
really aiming towards the system l2

694
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
world um

695
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,799
as well as kind of a unified graph world

696
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,559
too so if you look at the architecture

697
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,240
description that's published for mms

698
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
five

699
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
it really paints a clear path for how

700
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
the mms will support the system l2

701
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
service api

702
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
but also how it will be capable of

703
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,279
providing

704
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,559
support for

705
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,360
other

706
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,640
model based formats like graphql or oslc

707
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
or such like that

708
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,360
and and provide have the facilities

709
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
behind the scenes to have a scalable

710
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,120
unified graph

711
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,279
of information behind it so

712
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,320
um

713
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
i think i think that's where the future

714
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,679
is

715
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,480
is coming and it will

716
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,679
it'll be more and more of a

717
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,640
heterogeneous enterprise so

718
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
i do know that boeing certified their

719
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,360
their open their

720
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,559
uh

721
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,039
deployment of openmb to the dl178

722
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,520
standard so it is qualifiable in that

723
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,520
respect

724
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
and can you name some other projects or

725
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,279
companies that already use openmv you so

726
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,760
you mentioned boeing and i guess nasa

727
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,120
also uses

728
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,320
openmpe

729
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
but there are there other ones

730
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
um

731
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
yeah i think uh i think i think ford is

732
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
going to do their pre do a presentation

733
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,960
on it um

734
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
at the workshop so that'll be something

735
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
to see i know stevens has done a lot

736
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
with it in the research and educational

737
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,159
community as has georgetech

738
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
um and i think one of the videos on

739
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,080
uh

740
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,360
youtube

741
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,960
actually shows a piece part of the

742
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
presentation shows

743
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,559
so highlights some of the organizations

744
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,000
that use it and of course as we were

745
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,799
talking about earlier uh some parts of

746
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,120
the omg are starting to use it

747
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,240
the sysml2 spec

748
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,279
team

749
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
is actually using it to generate the

750
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
system l2 specification um using system

751
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,799
l one and two i guess

752
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,600
um

753
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,880
so it's uh

754
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,240
um

755
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
yeah there are there are others not

756
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
everybody that i know about has

757
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
explicitly authorized me to

758
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
tell that story for them so

759
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,799
in some cases they've explicitly asked

760
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,520
me not to um so

761
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
yeah

762
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,559
but the the that that video has has the

763
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,919
the list

764
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,399
uh okay robert put it together in his

765
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,799
methodical way so

766
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,320
um

767
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
yeah i guess we will provide the link in

768
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,919
the description of the video here

769
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,960
and people can look it up we also said

770
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
um

771
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,679
yeah that we will

772
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
oh we already have linked the openmbe

773
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
youtube channel from our channel you can

774
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
switch over

775
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,279
a lot of interesting stuff there

776
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
yeah yeah you can get a demo without

777
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,080
installing it

778
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,080
yeah it's good to see that but i think

779
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,919
what's also emerged

780
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,000
as the most novel feature of view editor

781
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,360
is this notion of transclusion so

782
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,240
the inventor of the hyperlink whose name

783
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
escapes me at the moment

784
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,799
also invented this this concept called

785
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,559
transclusion which is like a reverse

786
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
hyperlink

787
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,559
where you dereference the content behind

788
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,840
the link and display it in place

789
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,080
um so in terms of

790
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,720
software application novelty the heart

791
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,679
of view editor is this ability to

792
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
transclude or as we locally refer to it

793
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
as cross-reference

794
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
pieces of the model in the document to

795
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,919
make it communicatable so

796
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,799
um

797
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,440
and that that simple principle pervades

798
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
all aspects of the software so

799
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
yeah and you can also edit the model

800
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,080
through the view editor right so some

801
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,919
some elements

802
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,279
correct

803
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,840
correctly that's

804
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
that's that's part of that notion

805
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,640
actually that because it's

806
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,080
cross-referenced

807
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,919
when you go to edit it you're actually

808
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,240
editing with the actual model element

809
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,320
and the repository not

810
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,120
not a wiki page that talks about it and

811
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
lets it get out of sync and stuff like

812
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
that so when you when you edit it in one

813
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,000
view

814
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
those edits will show up in all your

815
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
documents because it's using this

816
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
transclusion feature to be referenced

817
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,960
the content from a central location

818
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,080
cool

819
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,760
pretty cool

820
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,039
so now i can store many different models

821
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
in in the mms there can be a system

822
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
model bpmn

823
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
modelica or whatever everything can be

824
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
in mms and are these models in mms all

825
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,120
mix up or can can jump from one model to

826
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
another or

827
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
are they still insiders in the mms

828
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
so it's a big question so the key to

829
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,159
this interpolability issue

830
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,880
right right no the so the organizational

831
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,600
uh

832
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,640
schema if you will of mms is similar to

833
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,279
github so we have uh an org and a

834
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,279
project and then within that project you

835
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,960
can have multiple models

836
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
uh each of the models are are version

837
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
controlled um

838
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,520
and the uh

839
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
and and you can branch and stuff like

840
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,159
that

841
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,279
um

842
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,720
in in

843
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,679
in mms4 it doesn't have the greatest

844
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,600
merge capability

845
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,279
largely because

846
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,440
um

847
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
in modeling like

848
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,640
the the notion of of diff and merge is a

849
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,840
lot more sophisticated than it is in uh

850
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,679
um

851
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,399
in software code yeah exactly and i

852
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
think that i think actually the libra

853
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,279
libra folks

854
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,120
have uh included mms now in there i

855
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
should have thought of that on your

856
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,440
earlier question i think they've

857
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
included mms now in their lemon tree

858
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,399
product

859
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,760
um

860
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,840
that that that so you can buy that

861
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
additional capability there but yeah all

862
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
the models will go in there it's it's a

863
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
it's got a lot of the basic get features

864
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
around being able to branch

865
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,919
um and it keeps version history and

866
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
stuff like that so um that's the basic

867
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,919
organizational ski schema the key

868
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,440
difference between mms4 and mms 5

869
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
is the semantics of the model

870
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
in mms4 would still need to be added if

871
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
you wanted the service to understand

872
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,240
them so the service right now stores the

873
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,399
model but it doesn't really know about

874
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,720
the meaning of the model so like magic

875
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
drop for example extracts it but we rely

876
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
on the magic drop client to understand

877
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,440
it um

878
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,600
so and if you're working like python or

879
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
something like that then similarly you'd

880
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,240
have that situation an mms5 however with

881
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
the introduction of the graph database

882
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,159
uh you'll have those semantics stored in

883
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,039
the graph as part of what the model is

884
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,600
um so

885
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,320
that's the key distinction there

886
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
yeah and a very challenging technical

887
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,919
uh

888
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,240
activity

889
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,120
yes

890
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
sounds promising now

891
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
so i think we

892
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,279
will keep up with this topic and i guess

893
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,919
this would not be the last episode about

894
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,080
it

895
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,440
yeah chris uh then i would say

896
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
thank you very much for all the

897
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,279
information um

898
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,440
it was a pleasure uh having you on the

899
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
show

900
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,320
um tim what's our next topic

901
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,799
uh the next topic is model based product

902
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,840
line engineering and our guest will be

903
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,799
marco valengiri from airbus

904
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,000
and

905
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
that's scheduled for february the 7th

906
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
this monday

907
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,120
and same time

908
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,600
cool

909
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,840
yeah so

910
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,039
go ahead

911
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
yeah i i just wanted to remind uh all

912
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
our listeners who did not subscribe to

913
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,840
the youtube channel yet to do so chris

914
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,240
did uh some some weeks ago i saw

915
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,080
and yeah so you don't miss any other

916
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
episode

917
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
okay and so finally

918
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,039
our last words do not forget

919
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,399
trust us

920
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
we are systems engineers

921
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,120
okay bye-bye

922
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,519
bye chris
