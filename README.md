# The-MBSE-Podcast
This repo is used for translations of The MBSE Podcast episodes.

## How to contribute
If you want to contribute captions in a new language feel free to create a new branch for this language. It would be nice if you could name the branch like the ISO langauage code, you want to contribute, e.g. __de-DE__, __ja-JP__, __en-EN__

You can use your branch while translation an episode. Please make a pull request, at any time you´re ready with one or more episodes. 

If you´re adding a new language to an episode, please add a new folder with the ISO Language Code as the folder name.

## How to create translations
You can use [Amara](https://amara.org/en/) that is a free caption creation tool.

For more details, please see [Instruction](instruction.md) page.
